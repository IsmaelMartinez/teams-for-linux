It seems like there is a new policy preventing me from logging in.\r\n\r\nAfter some research, I found out:\r\n\r\n- Login via Browser (Vivaldi / Chrome / Firefox) does also not work.\r\n- Browser in Windows (Vivaldi) works, strange...\r\n- When I use Vivaldi on Linux and spoof my user agent as \"Chrome 122 on Windows\", it works (I am using a browser extension to do this).\r\n\r\nCan we somehow spoof the User Agent in teams-for-linux or make this configurable in a future release?\r\nIMHO the problem is my company not allowing some user agents...
