    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using the webcam with a background (such as blur, \"in the zone 1\", or \"in the zone 2\") the camera will zoom in, stretch (causing a lot pixelation), which then causes blurring all of the camera space. Making the camera unusable for meetings. \r\n\r\nYou can temporarily resolve it by removing the background, but then reapplying it will cause the issue to comeback.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n- Start meeting\r\n- Turn on webcam with blur/background\r\n- Wait\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA nice crisp webcam focused on me - with a blurry background\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: fedora 40 - gnome 46.5\r\n - Installation package flatpak (1.10.2), Also tried RPM 1.10.2 and the latest pre release 1.11 appimage\r\n\r\n**Debug**\r\n```txt\r\nuser@fedora:~/Documents$ flatpak run

Additional Info **\r\nTesting browsers to see how they function:\r\n\r\nChromium;\r\n- Camera exhibits the same behavior as the T4L App.\r\n\r\nFirefox:\r\n- Camera works but screensharing seems broken (Could be a local problem && unrelated anyway)\r\n",
