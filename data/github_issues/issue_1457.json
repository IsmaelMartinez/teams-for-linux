    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nOn Fedora 40 with Wayland. Recording a meeting works as expected, with the exception that only the users' webcams are shown, never the shared content. This occurs whether I start recording then share the screen, or share the screen then start recording. I always share a window as I have a 4k screen. Users on the call can see my screen share fine.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nAs above\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nScreen Recording captures screen share\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Fedora 40\r\n - Installation package: rpm\r\n - Version: 1.11.1\r\n\r\n**Debug**\r\nWhen possible, please run the application from the terminal using `--webDebug` and try to reproduce the error.\r\n\r\nThe provide in this section the output from both the terminal and the browser debug console.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nteams-for-linux --webDebug --logConfig='{}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT:* Ensure that you mask any sensitive information before posting the output.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n",
