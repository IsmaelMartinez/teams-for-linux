    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nIncrease the ringtone volume or add the ability to change the ringtone volume.\n\n### Motivation\n\nFirst of all, thank you for all the hard work you’ve put into creating and maintaining this fantastic app.\n\nI’m having an issue with notification sounds (call and message alerts): they’re too quiet. Ideally, I’d like to adjust the notification (_ringtone_) volume _independently_ of the other party’s voice volume.\n\nSo far, I’ve tried two workarounds, but neither is ideal:\n1. Increase Chromium volume (as described in #1136)\nBut his boosts _all_ Teams sounds—ringtone, notifications and in‑call audio alike. While the ringtone becomes louder as expected, the other party’s voice also gets amplified, forcing me to lower my system volume during calls and remember to raise it again afterwards. This is inconvenient.\n\n2. Replace/amend the ringtone file\nThis requires repackaging the distro or writing custom scripts, which is complex, fragile, and impractical for non‑experts.\n\nIt would be great if you could add a feature to control notification volume _separately_ (e.g. include a louder ringtone—e.g. 1.5× the current level, or other solution) in the application. Thank you!\n\nThe issue is observed in the following environment: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS amd46 with the latest updates, teams-for-linux 2.1.0 (also in 2.0.x versions).\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
