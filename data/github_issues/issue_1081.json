Please describe.**\r\nI want to have Teams show as \"away\" when I lock my screen, this doesn't happen due to my choice in window manager / screen lock.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd a cli option to either:\r\n- send a http request as if it was from inside the app, this would enable me to simply extract the correct request using dev tools and do e.g.: `teams-for-linux curl 'https://presence.teams.microsoft.com/v1/me/forceavailability/' -X 'PUT' --data-raw '{\"availability\":\"Away\"}'\r\n- dedicated function for this, and maybe other things in the future, e.g.: `teams-for-linux set-availibility away`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nManually set my self to `away` every time I lock my screen and unset it afterward.\r\n",
