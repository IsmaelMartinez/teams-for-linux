    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n`Ctrl + Shift + I` is the shortcut for important messages (still working, despite that feature having disappeared from message formatting: go figureâ€¦ M$ as usual?).\r\n\r\nHowever, it conflicts with browsers' shortcut for console (queries inspection).\r\nOne of the other behaviour might be triggered in the same context.\r\n\r\nFor my own experience, that shortcut in a new message marks it as important.\r\nHowever, replying in a conversation initially triggers console, and after a few tries, triggers the \"important message\" feature.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI am undecided on what course of action would be best.\r\nOn one hand, following Teams shortcut might be best as part of that application, but on the other hand, since in the end we are in a modified browser, following their \"standard\" might be nice too.\r\nBoth features have value.\r\n\r\n**Additional notes**\r\nWould there be other cases of conflict?",
