    "body": "From using teams4linux daily i notice my laptop goes into turbo mode whenever i enter a call and everyone turns on their cameras (and I have to turn on mine)\r\nThe teams v2 has a call health feature and displays that the videos are decrypted using SW.\r\n\r\nLooking to solve my issue, i tried to force enable HW encoding on chromium. Managed to do it but my video comes out with artifacts... But the performance improved.\r\n![image](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/assets/103443867/01cb7892-6f93-4b9c-9ee4-75659b5f24cb)\r\n\r\nSo I found this repo: https://github.com/StaZhu/enable-chromium-hevc-hardware-decoding which may help to enable HW encoding/decoding in electron. I know it talks about hevc and teams uses h264, but there might something that helps enabling both.\r\n\r\nFor reference, my work laptop is running Pop!_OS 22.04 on a i7-10610U \r\n\r\n ",
