    "body": "Upon startup, this app prompts for a login.  I would love it if the app could also connect to a Teams meeting _without_ a login such as through the URL provided in a Teams invite and/or by specifying the meeting ID and passcode via the method indicated here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/join-a-meeting\r\n\r\nI'm in a computing environment where the Admin gave us a video conferencing tool other than Teams and they make it difficult for folks to connect to a Teams meeting (I even get an error message about Teams being restricted by my Admin if I try to login on a device from home).  Unfortunately, most of our vendors host meetings via Teams, so being able to use this app to join a Teams meeting without a login could go a long way towards improving my Teams experience.  ",
