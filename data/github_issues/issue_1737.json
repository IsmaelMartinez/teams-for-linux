    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nAdd a toggle to disable or enable the pinch/zoom gestures\n\n### Motivation\n\nI am on a laptop running fedora 42 with gnome 48 wayland. I use touchpad gestures a lot with 3 fingers swipe to change between apps on the same virtual desktop and 4 fingers swipe to change virtual desktop. Only for this portal teams app I got weird issues on the touchpad gestures. Sometimes on the app it register as a pinch/zoom instead of doing the 3 or 4 fingers gestures. I dont have this issues using the official pwa ms teams on microsoft edge.\n\nI always use this apps full screen.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
