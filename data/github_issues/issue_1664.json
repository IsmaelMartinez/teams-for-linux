    "body": "**Issue to resolve**\r\non macOS, the Dock icon is controlled by the app bundle, not the BrowserWindow icon.  therefore on macOS the icon display on the Dock is always the icon comes from the app bundle.\r\n\r\n**Change**\r\nThis change allows the app to display the specified icon on Dock based on the icon configuration\r\n\r\n**Key Consideration for the change**\r\n\r\n1. the app-icon config provides customisation icon settings for **tray icons**, this is cool for windows but not Mac because it does not apply to the dock icon\r\n1. the app-icon is mis-leading, in my opinion it needs to be named **tray-icon** but I think we do not want to rename it to avoid unnecessary changes\r\n1. I also do not want to introduce a new \"dock-icon\" configuration either because I think it is unnecessary so I decided to reuse the app-icon configuration and added the auto icon resize on tray.js to accommodate  it \r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# run from app source\r\n\r\nelectron ./app --trace-warnings --app-title='New Custom Title' --app-icon=`pwd`/app/assets/icons/icon-custom-128x128.png\r\n```",
