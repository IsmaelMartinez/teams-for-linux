It defaults to my pin/fingerprint login but i cant select a other sign in method.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA extra option to sign in via a other methode when passkey is trying?\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nRemoving my passkey but it is also useful for other applications/web based login\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\nApparently it selects my last login method as default. If i login somewhere else through other means, the teams-linux client will remember that somehow. \r\n",
