    "body": "It would be helpful to have the option of writing the application output to a log file.\r\nThere are already a option to adjust log level `appLogLevels`but you can currently not write it to a file.\r\nFor example, it happens that meetings have a notification about the start in the electron UI, but no notification arrives at the notification daemon of the os.\r\n\r\nIf there is an option to write program output to a file, you could react to events while parsing the log file with an other process.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately `teams-for-linux 2>&1 >> logfile` is not really an option, as there can be problems here depending on the start method of teams-for-linux. For example, if you start it with a key combo in window managers like i3 there will be no log because of how its started by the wm.",
