    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nMake the Teams website \"believe\" it's running as a PWA.\n\n### Motivation\n\nIt would hide some things like the apps menu on the top left hand corner.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nYou could possibly manually hide those elements, similar to how uBlock Origin can hide them.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe manifest.json might help: https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/manifest.json\n\nJust opening this URL doesn't work, you probably have to spoof something else in the app for it to load as a PWA: https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/?clientType=pwa",
