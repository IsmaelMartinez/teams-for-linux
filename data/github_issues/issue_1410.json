    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen clicking a Teams 'join meeting' link in the Teams-for-linux calendar tab, I am directed out to Firefox and the meeting attempts to start in Firefox, instead of in the Teams-for-Linux client. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Go to teams-for-linux\r\n2. Go to the calendar tab\r\n3. Click on a meeting invitation (from an outside organisation). Find the 'join meeting' button.\r\n4. Click the 'join meeting' link\r\n5. Firefox opens the link and redirects to the meeting within Firefox.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nExpect the meeting to open within Teams for Linux.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n - Installation package teams-for-linux 1.10.2 deb\r\n - Version 1.10.2\r\n\r\n**Debug**\r\nNot done\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI note that my organisation uses aus01.safelinks.outlook.microsoft.com as a server for protecting users from phishing links etc. Perhaps teams-for-linux needs to do some processing on clicked links before handing off to firefox. Alternatively, perhaps a firefox add-in is needed to kick the request back to teams-for-linux.\r\n",
