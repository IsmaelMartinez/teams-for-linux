    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nThe app is by default opening the teams view. Customizing this by an entry in the config file would be great.\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe use teams-for-linux in our company mostly for chatting and calling.\nI almost never use the Teams view which is open by default when starting the application.\nAnd the first thing that I do almost every morning is switching to the Chat view.\nSometimes, I forget to do this and ignore some chat message since I don't see any bold entries in the left pane.\nUntil I realize that this is the pane that lists all my teams instead of all my chats.\nAs given in the title, it would be nice to have an option in the config file for defining the startup view.\nI would imagine that this is not a big deal, right?\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
