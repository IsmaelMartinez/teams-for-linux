    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen I join a meeting for a channel, the small black window doesnt appear which allows you to mute, share or view anyone others screen.\r\nIt does work when I am the first person who starts a meeting, but not if I join an ongoing meeting.\r\nI have tried the flatpak version and the snap version on Fedora 40.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to group chat where meeting is started\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb74baa6-fcf1-477b-97ec-0ef31d0c07fe)\r\n2. Click on this button:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5010f73-fc02-4aaf-b06a-72a72635d17a)\r\n3. I join the audio of the meeting but I am unable to mute or to share/view someones screen because the box is missing.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThis window is not showing up in the teams-for-linux application. I captured this image from the teams client on my macbook:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1e0919a-041b-433f-be8b-0bf5287b5106)\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nabove\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Fedora Linux 40\r\n - Installation package: flatpak & snap\r\n - Version: Portal for Teams                    com.github.IsmaelMartinez.teams_for_linux          1.11.0",
