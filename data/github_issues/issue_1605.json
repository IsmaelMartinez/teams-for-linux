    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nAn option to clear the current session after closing application without deleting configuration (background image, \"New Teams calendar\", ...)\n\n### Motivation\n\nAs long as #1357 is not fixed I prefer to relogin every morning but it's annoying that I have to set some locally saved configurations each day when I'm using the \"clearStorage\" option. So I would love to have a feature that only clears the session without deleting everything else.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
