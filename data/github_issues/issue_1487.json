    "body": "After the update to v1.11.5, the window cannot be resized anymore. It can only be used in a preset size (too small for many use cases) or in full screen.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Start fresh session.\r\n2. Move mouse pointer to any edge or corner of the Teams window.\r\n3. The mouse pointer does not change to the expected \"icon\" (like the \"corner\" or \"edge\" icon) and the size cannot be changed.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen moving the mouse pointer to any edge or corner of the Teams window, the mouse pointer should indicate that here, the size can be changed and the window size should be adjustable.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux 6.11.9-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun, 17 Nov 2024 16:06:17 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n - Installation package: flatpak\r\n - Version: 1.11.5\r\n - Gnome-shell 47.1-1, Wayland, electron 32.2.5-1 and 33.2.0-1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWhile the version from flatpak shows this behaviour, the one from the Arch Linux repository appears not to be affected and works as expected.\r\n",
