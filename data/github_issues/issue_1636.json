    "body": "### Can you reproduce this bug in the website/PWA?\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThe teams-for-linux.desktop since version 1.4.0 contains invalid data\n\n### What package are you using?\n\ndeb\n\n### Version\n\n1.4.0 and newer\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\nLook at the `/usr/share/applications/teams-for-linux.desktop`:\n\n```\n...\n\n[Desktop Action Name]\n0=T\n1=e\n2=a\n3=m\n4=s\n5= \n6=f\n7=o\n8=r\n9= \n10=L\n11=i\n12=n\n13=u\n14=x\n\n[Desktop Action Comment]\n0=U\n1=n\n2=o\n3=f\n4=f\n5=i\n6=c\n7=i\n8=a\n9=l\n10= \n11=c\n12=l\n13=i\n14=e\n15=n\n16=t\n17= \n18=f\n19=o\n20=r\n21= \n22=M\n23=i\n24=c\n25=r\n26=o\n27=s\n28=o\n29=f\n30=t\n31= \n32=T\n33=e\n34=a\n35=m\n36=s\n37= \n38=f\n39=o\n40=r\n41= \n42=L\n43=i\n44=n\n45=u\n46=x\n\n[Desktop Action StartupWMClass]\n0=t\n1=e\n2=a\n3=m\n4=s\n5=-\n6=f\n7=o\n8=r\n9=-\n10=l\n11=i\n12=n\n13=u\n14=x\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe package should contain a valid .desktop file\n\n### Additional context\n\nI re-package the .deb file for gentoo, and when updating to versions newer than 1.4.0 my build shows a lot of warnings:\n```\n * QA Notice: This package installs one or more .desktop files that do not\n * pass validation.\n * \n * \t/usr/share/applications/teams-for-linux.desktop: error: action group \"Desktop Action Comment\" exists, but
