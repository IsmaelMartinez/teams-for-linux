    "body": "Added a reimplementation of the call events to revive the incoming call scripts.\r\nAlso added an incoming call toast just like the one from the discontinued Linux Teams App from Microsoft.\r\n\r\nTo use the incoming call script feature there are two new config properties introduced **incomingCallCommand** and **incomingCallCommandArgs**.\r\n\r\nincomingCallCommand:\r\nThis property contains the command or executable to run on an incoming call.\r\nCaution: ~ in the path is currently not supported.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`{\r\n    \"incomingCallCommand\": \"/home/user/ring.sh\"\r\n}`\r\n\r\nAt default the following arguments get passed to the command/executable:\r\n1.  The name of the caller\r\n2.  The subtext of the original toast from the Teams web app\r\n3.  The image of the caller as base64 data image string\r\n\r\nincomingCallCommandArgs:\r\nThis property can contain an array of arguments that get prepend to the default arguments.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`{\r\n    \"incomingCallCommandArgs\": [\"-n\", \"example\"]\r\n}`\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use the new incoming call toast the new config property **enableIncomingCallToast** needs to be set to **true**.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`{\r\n    \"enableIncomingCallToast\": true\r\n}`\r\n\r\nAttention: The incoming call toast should open on the screen where your cursor is, unfortunately there is currently a bug in electron on Linux that prevents that feature -> https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/42519",
