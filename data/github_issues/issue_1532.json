Log out and quit Teams (using menu in tray).\r\n3. In a terminal type ps aux | grep teams | grep -v grep\r\n4. Find three processes labeled  /snap/teams-for-linux/724/teams-for-linux.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nQuitting an application should remove all its processes IMHO.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Kubuntu 24.10\r\n - Installation package snap\r\n - Version 1.12.5\r\n \r\n\r\n**Debug**\r\nSee attached file.\r\n[teamsdebug.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18218425/teamsdebug.txt)\r\n\r\n",
