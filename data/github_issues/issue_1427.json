Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /opt/teams-for-linux/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.\r\n\r\nSeems to be caused by the Electron update and related to this issue: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/42510\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Teams for Linux v1.11.0 on Ubuntu 24.04.\r\n2. Try to launch the application.\r\n3. Error.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI launch the application and it launches.\r\n\r\n**Desktop:**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS\r\n - Installation package: deb\r\n - Version: 1.11.0\r\n\r\n**Debug**\r\n\r\nDoes not output anything extra besides the error mentioned at the beginning.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nCan be worked around by lifting Ubuntu's restrictions: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/42510#issuecomment-2171583086, I am however pretty sure this is not the correct solution.\r\n",
