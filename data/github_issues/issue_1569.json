    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nUpdate the flatpak runtime to `org.freedesktop.Platform/x86_64/24.08`\n\n### Motivation\n\nWhen looking into my installed flatpacks, I see that TfL v1.12.7 is using, as only one,  the runtime:\n`org.freedesktop.Platform/x86_64/23.08` while all others have `org.freedesktop.Platform/x86_64/24.08`\n\nFor resource optimisation, I ask if the runtime could be upgraded.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
