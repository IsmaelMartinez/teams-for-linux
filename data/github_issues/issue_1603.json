    "body": "### Can you reproduce this bug in the website/PWA?\n\nNot sure\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI am using Ubuntu 24.04 and have installed Dash-to-panel.  Your Teams for Linux Icon is pinned to the pannel. When I get a new teams message - the numeric counter shows a \"1\" for about 3 or 4 seconds.  Then the number disappears.  If I have the notifications are visible when the Teams message come in - the message is there for about 2-3 seconds - then disappears.  Seems to me like there is some kind of \"auto-message-acknoledge\" going on.  Any suggestions ?\n\nWas using a slightly older version that I installed using the directions from this site a while back.  Using \"apt-cache policy teams-for-linux\" the version was 1.12.7.  I checked the Ubuntu store - and 1.13.1 was available via .deb.  So I uninstalled 1.12.7 and installed 1.13.1 from the store. \n\napt-cache policy teams-for-linux\nteams-for-linux:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 1.13.1\n  Version table:\n     1.13.1 500\n        500 https://repo.teamsforlinux.de/debian stable/main amd64 Packages\n     1.12.7 -1\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1154c3f3-e1cf-42f9-9727-b04d993dd849)\n\nStill have same issue.  When a new chat message come in it is visible in the Notificaitons for 3-4 seconds and Tams icon shows a \"1\".  But after 3-4 seconds the notificaiton is  cleared and number on icon disappears.\n\n### What package are you using?\n\ndeb from Ubuntu store - version 1.13.1\n\nWas using a slightly older version that I installed using the directions from this site a while back.
