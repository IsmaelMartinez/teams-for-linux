What are the problems?\r\n\r\n- It only works with one organisation\r\n- Well you can log out and login but there's a terrible bug. After log out when you try to login with another domain, it just does not work. This bug exists for a long time. Anyway..\r\n- I work with 3 different Teams Organisations everyday. Absolutely not possible with the official client.\r\n- I'm still unsure on why can't they do it.\r\n\r\nWhat I've tried is to have multiple snaps with different names when installing. One instance itself works slowly. I imagine how it would be when there are 3.\r\n\r\nThen, I started my own personal experiment and created a multi tenant electron wrapper. Currently I enjoy using it. I had no intentions to make it public rather I consider it as a work around for the troubles I had faced.\r\n\r\nWhat are your suggestions about this feature? Is it worth?</div>",
