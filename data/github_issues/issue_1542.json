    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nAbility to open a meeting using only id and key\n\n### Motivation\n\nCurrently Teams help at MS try to say that open calendar in teams and open from there. I just had a public conference meeting that was copy&pasted into calendar, so teams did not recognize the link. Link opens browser. Could not find anywhere to use ID/key and MS web-page for id/key again just opens the browser.\r\n\r\nThis might not be a problem with teams-for-linux as such, but looking for a work around. Perhaps teams-for linux could have a menu-item where one could enter id/key, perhaps also a meeting url since recent MS shenanigans.\r\nPersonally I rather not use Teams at all, unfortunately it is not something I can do at work.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
