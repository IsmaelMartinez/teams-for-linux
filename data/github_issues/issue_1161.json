    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI recently discovered a setting under the user options (when clicking on my avatar in the top-right) to specify whether I am working remotely or in the office. Given the flexible working arrangements, this may be quite useful to know if colleagues are in, and to let them know if I am, but the setting is manual (it resets daily), and it is easy to forget to set it up.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/assets/5610438/e94fc6cd-392b-40b4-abb5-071e5b20486a)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI do have an office computer and a home one, so potentially a launch or configuration setting that would set this up automatically would be great (i.e., my office computer always sets it as \"in the office\"). Alternatively, this could also be defined by IP (i.e., my institution has a static IP range, so it should be easy to check whether I am in the office or somewhere else and set this automatically), which might be more flexible.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatively, some kind of popup when the setting is not yet set and teams are started for the first time or something could be useful to remember to set this (ideally enabled through a config?).\r\n\r\n",
