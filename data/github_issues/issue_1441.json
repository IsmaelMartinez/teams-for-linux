Please describe.**\r\nIf there are more than 3 people with their webcams active, Teams starts to consume a lot of CPU, and my outgoing video and sound start to fail\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMaybe reduce incoming video quality? I've noticed that if I explicitly disable incoming video, Teams functions fine again, but it's boring not seeing anyone :smiling_face_with_tear: \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI can't think of anything else, sorry\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm not an expert in video nor programing, so maybe this is just impossible :sweat_smile: \r\n",
