    "title": "[Solution] Wayland: fix team scaling on HiDPI + scaling/fractional scaling",
    "body": "Hi,\nI am using this project under [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway)/wayland. Also using HiDPI with scaling (eg fractional scale). This is leading to problems with ugly/fuzzy fonts when running on such display. \n\nTo cure this problem I removed `/usr/bin/teams-for-linux` symlink and put a file there with the following contents:\n```bash\n#!/bin/sh\nexec /opt/teams-for-linux/teams-for-linux --ozone-platform-hint=wayland \"$@\"\n```\nAnd made this file executable. After this it is starting as native wayland app and fonts/UI is crystal clear :)\nMaybe this would help someone...\n\nThis is how it looks before/after:\n<img width=\"3844\" height=\"2160\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57c676fe-4bd1-4d84-85ae-b87ae9fda195\" />\n\n@IsmaelMartinez please close if you like - this is only for helping other with similar problem or to reference...",
