    "body": "### Can you reproduce this bug in the PWA?\n\nNo\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nDuring a call, with microphone unmuted, if an audio is played is transmitted along the mic audio\n\n### What package are you using?\n\nflatpak\n\n### Version\n\n1.12.7\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n```markdown\n1. Start or enter a call\n2. Check that the microphone is unmuted\n3. Play whatever audio from whatever software (browser, VLC, WhatsApp or Telegram audio message, other players)\n4. The other call participant(s) will listen to your audio transmitted along with the microphone audio (this not happens with muted mic)\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n```markdown\nThe output audio is reproduced on the output device (speakers, headphones) for the user only and not transmitted along the microphone.\n```\n\n### Debug\n\n```markdown\n\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nTo be clear, it's not like the output audio \"re-enters\" in the microphone, it's like the output audio is mixed with the input mic stream. Bug reproduced on Fedora 41, Portal for Linux installed from flatpak.",
