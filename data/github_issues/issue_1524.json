    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen I put my computer to sleep and then someone sends me messages on Teams, sometimes those messages don't show up when I wake the PC up, even after the network connection is re-established.\r\n\r\nFurther incoming messages do show up though, placing the chat in an inconsistent state (missing messages).\r\n\r\nIf I press CTRL+R to reload Teams, the missing messages show up and everything goes back to normal.\r\n\r\nThis is not 100% reproducible every time, which makes me thing it might depend on how fast the PC can restore the network connection after waking up.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open Teams.\r\n2. Put PC to sleep.\r\n3. Ask someone to send you a message while the PC is sleeping.\r\n4. Wake PC from sleep.\r\n5. Notice that the message does not show up on the chat.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe messages should show up as soon as the network connection is re-established.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Arch Linux\r\n - Installation package AUR\r\n - Version 1.12.3\r\n\r\nIf you believe it can help, I can provide logs the next time it happens.",
