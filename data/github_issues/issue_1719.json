    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nInclude Names and Time Stamps in Copy&Paste to Text\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe often copy parts of chats to our issue tracker for documentation purpose.\n\n* Ctrl+C in the Chat Window\n* Ctrl+Shift+V in the issue tracker (to exclude formatting)\n\nThis worked great until half year ago or so and produced text output like this:\n\n[12:10] Me: Which color should be the button?\n[12:14] John Doe: Blue please\n\nBut nowadays it produces only\n\n\nWhich color should be the button?\nBlue please\n\nSo it's heard to see who said what.\n\nI would be nice to include this user info and timestamp.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nAdding those infos tediously manually.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
