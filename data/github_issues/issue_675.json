    "body": "It looks like Microsoft have changed their teams.microsoft.com site's behaviour: while before, when opening a meeting invitation in a browser one would get prompted to either open in the browser or in the app, the site now immediately redirects into the teams webapp in the browser, no way to open the meeting in the app. \r\n\r\n![teams-screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/383271/216048308-97bb1ef0-d544-4793-bff0-7af949aff917.png)\r\n\r\nThe above screenshot shows what I can see for a few milliseconds before the redirect takes place (and nothing on the right side is linked to anything). The native dialogue asking me which app I want to open the link with no longer appears.\r\n\r\nAll my Linux-using colleagues have had the same problem since this morning.\r\n\r\nThis is of course not a problem of teams-for-linux, but since MS may not be willing to change this (annoying) behaviour, I'd like to ask around whether anyone has found a workaround for this?\r\n\r\n[edit] This behaviour is triggered by a \"Linux\" in the user agent. \r\n\r\n",
