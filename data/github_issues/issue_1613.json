    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nWhen I join or leave a meeting, the teams-for-linux app could emit an event so another application can subscribe to it and perform custom actions.\n\n### Motivation\n\nWhen working from home, I would utilize these events to turn on and off a busy-light at my office door while I participate in a meeting. That way, the spouse/kids in the house would know when not to enter the room.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nClosing/opening the door is somewhat cumbersome.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
