Please describe.**\r\nI want to get the details of the current meeting every time I join a call for my journaling.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAn option like incomingCallCommand (joinCallCommand?) would work if I could put the meeting's JSON to the args (or at least the meeting ID/join link)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nMS Graph APIs won't let me see the call I've joined.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIdeally, that would be a JSON like the one provided by MS APIs, but even a meetingID or a join link would work. With ID or a join link I could query the Graph API to get the data.\r\n\r\nMS call JSON object:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/call-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http\r\n",
