    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nI use system mic mute and really need to update my mute/unmute status in meetings\n\n### Motivation\n\nIt would be nice to have conditional feature to be automatically muted/unmuted in meeting when Teams for Linux detects that Teams detected muted/unmuted mic on system side. \nTeams already shows buble about muted mic on system side during meeting, but don't switch mute/unmute status on meeting.\n\nIs possible to detect this event in Teams for Linux and switch this mute/unmute status on meeting?\n\n### Alternatives\n\nOr is alternatively possible create mute/unmute DBUS event listener in Teams for Linux so I mute/unmute from external script?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
