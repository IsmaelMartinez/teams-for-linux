    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nSince the latest Plasma Update in Debian Sid, external URLs won't open in the system's default browser (in my case Firefox) window anymore. The Not-Allowed cursor shorty flashes and the debug console writes:\r\n```\r\n08:51:48.380 â€º Requesting to open 'https://some.link'\r\n```\r\nbut nothing happens. Internal links to other channels seem to work fine.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Find a message with an external URL\r\n2. Click on the URL\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe link opens in your default browser in a new tab.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Debian Sid, KDE Plasma 6.2.3, Wayland\r\n - teams-for-linux 1.12.1, Debian package\r\n\r\nIf I can help out with more information, please let me know.",
