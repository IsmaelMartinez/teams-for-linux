Feel free to close this issue but maybe a small exception handler would avoid this issue already.\r\n\r\nMy version is/was rather old but I checked the changes between v1.11.5 and v1.12.5 and couldn't find anything touching that code (I didn't check the flatpak repo though).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nNo uncaught exception dialog.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Debug\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43ba95bc-12ac-4a3a-bf86-7fe618bd4c14)\r\n",
