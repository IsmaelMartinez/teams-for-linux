Please describe.**\r\nIntune does not support the system that I am using.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI hope the answer to this request is not something already available: my search (and my understanding) didn't lead me to anything useful.\r\n\r\nI'd like to pass an `oauth` token obtained form another machine to `teams-for-linux`. Is this currently possible or can it be potentially enabled?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThat's the only solution to the problem that I can think of.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAvailable on specific request.\r\n",
