    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nApplication lets click through the window's border (both titlebar and app's content) instead of receiving the input itself.\r\nCheck video, it should be explanatory enough :)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Use Wayland\r\n2. Open app\r\n3. Try to click on the outer border of the app (like 10px more-less)\r\n4. App or object behind (on Z axis) receives the input\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nApp should receive the input, not what's behind it.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9408e6e5-174c-4e30-8bdd-c08a29158749\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0a5a2e4-ef99-4159-b316-159b3d668da5\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Fedora 41 Workstation\r\n - Installation package: RPM\r\n - Version 1.11.2\r\n\r\n**Debug**\r\nDebug doesn't output anything\r\n\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT:* Ensure that you mask any sensitive information before posting the output.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTested on GNOME and Weston, it does show the same behavior.",
