    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nAbility to hide message notifications, unread message count\n\n### Motivation\n\nThere are already some very nice options for disabling notifications:\n\n- Disable all notifications\n- Disable meeting notification\n- Disable notifications sound\n- Disable sound when not available (e.g. busy, in a call)\n- Disable window flash on new notifications\n\nI would like two additional options:\n\n- Hide unread message count: Sometimes I need to really focus, and the message notifications can be really distracting. Even the unread message count can be difficult to ignore when I need to focus on something difficult but my brain wants an excuse to do something else :)\n- Disable message notifications: Similar to disable meeting notifications, however I typically want the opposite; I don't want to hide meeting notifications because I don't want to miss a meeting, but message notifications can be frequent and disatracting\n\nBeyond this, I think it's great that that there's an option to _Disable sound when not available_. However, why is this the only option that applies when not available? I would like this ability for all of the options. However, with the current UX this would result in duplicating all of the options, e.g.\n\n- Disable meeting notifications\n- Disable meeting notifications when not available\n- Disable notifications sound\n- Disable notifications sound when not available\n- Disable window flash on new notifications\n- Disable window flash on new notifications when not available\n\nRather than duplicating all of these options, what if this was made a separate option, such as:\n\n- Only disable notifications when not available\n\nThen it could be applied to all.\n\nSo my final proposal would be something like:\n\n- Disable all notifications\n- Disable meeting notifications\n- Disable message notifications\n- Disable notification sound\n- Disable window flash on new notifications\n- Hide unread message count\n- Only apply these settings when not available (e.g. busy, in a call)\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI would be happy to work on a PR for any or all of this functionality.\n\nThanks!\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
