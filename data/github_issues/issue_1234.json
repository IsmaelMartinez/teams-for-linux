    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nNotifications sent to notification-daemon no longer happen with the \"new teams\".\r\nThis does work - if somewhat erratically - with the \"classic teams\". I have tried both \"web\" and \"electron\" notification methods with the same results.\r\nUseMutationTitleLogic does work for systray icon changes for \"permanent\" notifications, it's just the transient ones which are missing.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1) Start Teams\r\n2) Have someone else start a meeting you are present at / send a chat message\r\n3) Nothing happens\r\n4) Use `notify-send` to test notification daemon\r\n5) Receive notification as normal\r\n(There is presumably more to it than this as other people have mentioned in other issues that it works for them, but I can't tell what, unfortunately)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNotifications of new meetings, chat messages, etc. sent to notification daemon as with classic teams\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Debian stable, Windowmaker desktop with notification-daemon to handle notifications\r\n - deb package install\r\n - 1.4.27\r\n\r\n**Debug**\r\nThe main obvious error seems to be\r\n\r\nFailed to start Activity Hub by assigning Event Handlers\r\nerror @ v2/:3\r\n(anonymous) @ /opt/teams-for-linux/resources/app.asar/app/browser/tools/activityHub.js:44\r\n\r\nFull log: [teams.log](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/files/15150302/teams.log)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Sorry, this doesn't feel like a lot of help - happy to answer more detailed questions about my system config and try other config settings, etc.)\r\n",
