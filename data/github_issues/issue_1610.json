    "title": "[Feat]: Compatibility with password managers",
    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nTeams for Linux should support integrating with password managers such as 1Password.\n\n### Motivation\n\nWhen running the PWA from a regular browser, I can use the browser's plugins, including 1Password. This enables me to log in without pasting email addresses and passwords between 1Password and Teams — and allows me to use the passkey saved in 1Password for 2FA.\n\nThis will be particularly important if my employer mandates passkey-based 2FA and locks out TOTP and other methods on company accounts.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n- Continuing to use a PWA installed under Chromium: not ideal as it keeps resetting the custom Teams icon I have given it to the Chrome icon, as it does with every other PWA\n- Using a less secure method of 2FA: not ideal, as pasting email and password is already enough hassle without having to do it with TOTP codes too\n- Asking my boss for a Macbook Pro and using macOS with its native app instead of Linux: at around ₤3200 for an equivalent machine, probably not very likely :)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
