Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen using camera that relies on libcamera (the most famous is ipu6 cams from intel, cf https://jgrulich.cz/2024/12/13/when-your-webcam-doesnt-work-solving-firefox-and-pipewire-issues/ for some related context), chrome must be configured to use pipewire for the camera in one of its flags:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e371e13-b086-4ca3-bfdf-c334b499c594)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIdeally IÂ would like to have a switch somewhere in the config (because I guess not everybody wants this feature) that would enable the flag.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing chromium or firefox directly and not this app :)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI worry that it's not possible to do this from teams-for-linux and that support must be added directly at the electron level?\r\n",
