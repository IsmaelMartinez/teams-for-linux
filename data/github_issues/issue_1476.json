    "body": "The basic idea is to split participants of a meeting in different rooms. In teaching this is useful for practical team work\r\n\r\nHere is official info about breakout rooms:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-breakout-rooms-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-7de1f48a-da07-466c-a5ab-4ebace28e461\r\n\r\nApparently it's supported only in Windows and Mac systems but I don't know if this is due to some technical constraint or it could be somehow workarounded.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help and time invested in teams-for-linux, very appreciated!\r\n\r\n",
