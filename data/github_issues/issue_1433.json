    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI changed my settings for the microsoft account to another 2FA method (YubiKey).\r\nI logged out from the microsoft account and restarted ms-teams.\r\nWhen I want to login, I type in my account e-mail and go on.\r\nI guess a window should open now where I can enter my PIN and the Token to get access to the account, but nothing shows up.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the process recognized, that something is wrong and offered me to use my password.\r\nUsing this, I could log in myself just using the password.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Enable a 2FA method using a YubiKey or something similar\r\n2. Log out from ms-teams account\r\n3. Restart ms-teams\r\n4. Follow the login process, which will stuck after entering the account e-mail\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect a pop up window to open where I can enter the login credentials (YubiKey Pin and access token)\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nScreenshot showing the last state where the process stucks.\r\nNo browser window is opened and nothing else happens for like 5 minutes.\r\n![Bildschirmfoto vom 2024-10-04 09-52-55](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2abaff87-539a-4aa6-b2c8-bc703619c060)\r\n\r\n**Desktop**\r\n - OS: Linux Ubuntu 22.04\r\n - Installation package snap via Ubuntu Software Center\r\n - Version 1415/24081700421\r\n\r\n**Debug**\r\nDebug execution lets teams quit after several seconds.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNothing to add.\r\n",
