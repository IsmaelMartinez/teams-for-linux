    "body": "### Can you reproduce this bug in the website/PWA?\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen teams for linux is running, I am not able to open more than one window of the application.\n\n### What package are you using?\n\nflatpak\n\n### Version\n\n1.12.7\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n```markdown\nOn ubuntu 24.04:\n\n1. Open teams for linux\n2. Right click on the icon of the application in the task bar\n3. Click on \"New Window\": nothing happens\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n```markdown\nA new window opens.\n```\n\n### Debug\n\n```markdown\n\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nI think this is crucial for people that work in several organizations, and need to look at them at the same time (e.g. while there is a meeting in a organization, chatting in another one...).\nRight now I am forced to choose which organization use on the app, and I have to use the other organizations in the browser.\nI am not sure if this is just a problem of the flatpak build.",
