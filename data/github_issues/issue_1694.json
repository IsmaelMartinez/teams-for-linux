    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nWhen starting up Teams for Linux, have a setting that makes it only start minimized to tray.\n\n### Motivation\n\nTeams for Linux is one of the windows that I have set on my work profile to auto-open. To reduce clutter and maintain a cleaner working environment, I like to start it minimized using the --minimized flag on the startup command. However, this was not trivial to find as it is not exposed anywhere in the UI. \n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
