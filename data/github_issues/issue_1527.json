    "body": "#### `firejail teams-for-linux` requires `/opt/teams-for-linux/chrome-sandbox` owned by root and has mode 4755\r\n\r\n#### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open linux terminal (gnome-terminal or tilix)\r\n2. Type `firejail teams-for-linux`\r\n3. See error: `The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /opt/teams-for-linux/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755. Parent is shutting down, bye...`\r\n\r\n#### Tried the [proposed solution](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/1426#issuecomment-2384889316) to add apparmour file. It didn't solve the issue.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed solution(s)\r\n\r\nTo fix this, the debian install script needs to make a `chmod 4755 $(pkgdir_buildroot_debian)/opt/teams-for-linux/chrome-sandbox` or have a `debian/postinst` file which does `chmod 4755 /opt/teams-for-linux/chrome-sandbox` after install. Probably needed for all distributions, such as Fedora/openSUSE/Archlinux/Manjaro.\r\n\r\n#### System\r\n\r\n - OS: Ubuntu Budgie 24.04\r\n - Installation package: deb (from your repository)\r\n - Version: 1.12.3\r\n\r\n#### Reference(s)\r\n\r\nMaybe similar root cause as in issue [#1426](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/1426#issuecomment-2431985357) but there is no concrete solution in the thread mentioning `firejail` and the choice to force changed permissions on the affected directory when the DEB package is created or include a `postinst` file to fix the issue after install.",
