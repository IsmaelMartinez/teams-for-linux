    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nCan someone help me lower video receive resolution via launch command? \n\n### Motivation\n\nHi there\n\nCan anyone help me edit my launch command for Teams so that it runs on a much lower video receive resolution?\n\nI ask because I cannot find any settings to edit in the application itself. I only have a low-megabit internet connection, and the high quality of the received Teams video is causing lag and delay.\n\nI also ask because I was able to edit the launch command to disable GPU, which solved a blurry video problem I kept running into. If there is a command for that, Iâ€™m hoping that there will be a command to drop the receive video resolution to super-low res.\n\nHere is the launch command as it stands:\n\n**env BAMF_DESKTOP_FILE_HINT=/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/teams-for-linux_teams-for-linux.desktop /var/lib/snapd/snap/bin/teams-for-linux %U disable-gpu**\n\nThanks\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
