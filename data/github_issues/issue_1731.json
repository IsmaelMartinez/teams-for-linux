    "body": "### Can you reproduce this bug in the website/PWA?\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Describe the bug\n\ntfl 2.0.17 does not start (crashes) on Rocky Linux 9 (MATE desktop) and yells about a GTK 2-3/4 symbols mix in output.\n\n### What package are you using?\n\nrpm\n\n### Version\n\n2.0.17\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n```markdown\nStart tfl 2.0.17 in Rocky Linux 9, within a MATE desktop:\n\n$ cat /etc/system-release\nRocky Linux release 9.6 (Blue Onyx)\n\n$ echo $DESKTOP_SESSION\nmate\n\n$ teams-for-linux\nInitialising logger with config: {\"transports\":{\"console\":{\"level\":\"info\"},\"file\":{\"level\":false}}}\n13:28:00.697 âº configPath: $HOME/.config/teams-for-linux\n13:28:00.803 âº (node:3591249) [DEP0180] DeprecationWarning: fs.Stats constructor is deprecated.\n(Use `teams-for-linux --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)\n\n(process:3591249): Gtk-ERROR **: 13:28:00.809: GTK 2/3 symbols detected. Using GTK 2/3 and GTK 4 in the same process is not supported\nteams-for-linux: line 9: 3591249 Trace/breakpoint trap   (core dumped) /opt/teams-for-linux/teams-for-linux\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\ntfl should start and work like 2.0.16 does.\nWhen I saw the mention \"GNOME Users: Electron 36+ defaults to GTK 4 on GNOME. If you experience theming issues, you can use GTK 3 mode.\" in the 2.0.17 release notes, I was pretty sure something could go wrong with 2.0.17, tried it and voila. Not sure this is a conflict with MATE (which is GTK3), I could not test yet in a GNOME desktop on RL9 yet.\n",
