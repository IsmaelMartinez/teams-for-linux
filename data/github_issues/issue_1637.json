    "body": "### Can you reproduce this bug in the website/PWA?\n\nNo\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI have meetings in the calendar, with teams links and code/password. However, for some meetings the \"Join\" button is not shown. When opening the calendar item and clicking the link nothing happens (firefox opens, but it does not forward to teams app - this might be an issue with firefox settings, but i dont know what to do), also there is nowhere an option to \"join meeting with code\". So sadly this teams port is useless for me as approx 25% of the meetings cannot be joined. I have not found out what the differences are in the invite (i use thunderbird).\n\n### What package are you using?\n\ndeb\n\n### Version\n\nlatest\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n```markdown\n1.\n2.\n3.\n...\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n```markdown\n1.\n2.\n3.\n...\n```\n\n### Debug\n\n```markdown\nteams-for-linux --webDebug --logConfig='{}'\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
