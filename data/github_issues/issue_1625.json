    "body": "### Can you reproduce this bug in the website/PWA?\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nAfter updating teams4linux, the application doesn't start when clicking the icon. If it was still running, the application window won't open either.\n\n### What package are you using?\n\ndeb\n\n### Version\n\nSo far: any!\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n```markdown\n1. Close Teams\n2. Update (maybe also happens on a fresh install -- not sure & not tested)\n3. Try to open Teams\n\nIf I try to run Teams from bash, the reason for it not starting is shown:\n\n[48366:0328/145817.029483:FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(163)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /opt/teams-for-linux/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.\n\nWhen changing the permissions everything works again. I would prefer however if I didn't have to change this myself after every update.\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n```markdown\n1. Teams opens when clicking the icon after an update\n```\n\n### Debug\n\n```markdown\n\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nOS (in case it's specific to this OS):\nDistributor ID:\tUbuntu\nDescription:\tUbuntu 24.04.2 LTS\nRelease:\t24.04\nCodename:\tnoble\n",
