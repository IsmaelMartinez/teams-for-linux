    "body": "Hi, I installed pre-release  1.12 and app started to crash (not always) when trying to select screen/windows to share.\r\nProbably it was occurring  when I was already sharing smth in the session, then somebody took the screen and I wanted take it back. Not sure 100% that's the only case but this I remembered and it was always during meeting in the work so no time to debug :(\r\nI'm using debian 12 with X11.\r\nPlease give me some advices how to start teams (flags to enable logs,change levels), which logs/files deliver etc. to help you investigate problem - unfortunately I got very busy time now and have no time to RTFM :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance gw.\r\n",
