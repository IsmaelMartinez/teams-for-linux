    "body": "### Can you reproduce this bug in the website/PWA?\n\nNo\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhenever I go away from my computer, I will keep being shown as 'online' (green icon). My status only changes when I am in a meeting/call (red) or have an entry in the calendar that says 'working elsewhere' (icons turn dark green / dark red). I need to explicitly set my status to 'away' or 'offline' for people to see I am not at my computer.\n\n### What package are you using?\n\ndeb\n\n### Version\n\n1.13.1 (I think, can't find it in the UI!)\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n```markdown\n1. Start Teams\n2. Go away for a while\n3. Check status from another account\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n```markdown\n1.
