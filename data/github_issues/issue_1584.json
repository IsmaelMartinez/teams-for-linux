    "title": "[Feat]: Remove teams-v1 support (EOL)",
    "body": "### Describe the feature\n\nRemove teams-v1 support as it reaches end of life\n\n### Motivation\n\nCurrently, we default to teams-v1 allowing users to enable teams-v2.\n\nThis is a soft configuration that gracefully handles when people has already moved to teams-v2, but implies a lot of extra code that is now dead for teams-v1\n\nAs https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability is reaching EOL in the 1st of july, it will be great to have a release ready before that. \n\nThat will remove a lot of code that is only teams-v1 specific.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nLeave the dead code in there and default to teams-v2, or pretend this didn't happen\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
