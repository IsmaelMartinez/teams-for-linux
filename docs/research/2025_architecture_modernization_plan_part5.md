# PHASE 24: The Generational Shift (Meetings 501-530)

## Meeting 501: New Maintainer Generation

**New Maintainer (Nova):** Hi everyone. I'm taking over as lead maintainer.

**Simple:** Welcome. I'm stepping back after 7 years.

**Nova:** Any advice?

**Simple:** Read the code. It explains itself. Follow the principles. Don't overthink.

---

## Meeting 502: The Handover

**Simple:** Key things to know:
1. Electron upgrades are routine
2. Teams breaks quarterly
3. Users self-support mostly
4. Sponsors expect nothing
5. The Matrix room moderates itself

**Nova:** Sounds manageable.

**Simple:** It is. By design.

---

## Meeting 503: Nova's First Week

**Nova:** I read the codebase. All of it.

**Arch:** How long?

**Nova:** Two evenings. 6200 lines is readable.

**Simple:** That's the point.

---

## Meeting 504: Nova's Observations

**Nova:** Observations:
1. Code is remarkably clean
2. No magic, no tricks
3. Everything is documented
4. Tests cover what matters
5. I understand the why, not just the what

**Simple:** Mission accomplished.

---

## Meeting 505: The First Solo Decision

**Nova:** User requests feature: Slack status bridge.

---

## Meeting 506: Simple's Departure

**Nova:** Smooth. 4-hour effort. No issues.

---

## Meeting 508: Nova's Philosophy

- Don't add, don't remove. Maintain.

**Arch:** Different but aligned.

---

## Meeting 509: The 8-Year Anniversary

**PM:** 8 years. Different team, same project.

---

## Meeting 510: The Technology Landscape

**Nova:** Tech in 2033:
- WebAssembly everywhere
- WASM-based apps common
- Electron still works
- Tauri mature

**Nova:** Should we reconsider?

**Arch:** For what benefit?

**Nova:** Smaller binary.

**Arch:** Users don't complain. Status quo.

---

## Meeting 511: The Teams Landscape

**Nova:** Teams in 2033:
- Still web-based
- More stable than ever
- Microsoft native Linux app is... mediocre

**PM:** We still have users?

**Nova:** 12,000 active. Down from 15,000.

---

## Meeting 512: The Decline Acceptance

**Nova:** We're declining. Is that okay?

**Arch:** All software declines eventually.

**Nova:** Should we do something?

**Arch:** Do what we do. Serve who's here.

---

- 90% satisfied
- 5% want more features
- 5% will leave eventually

**Nova:** 90% satisfaction is excellent.

---

---

---

- Both Electron upgrades
- No feature changes

**Nova:** Predictable. Boring. Good.

---

## Meeting 520: The Succession Question

**Nova:** Who succeeds me?

**Arch:** Anyone can fork.

**Nova:** But maintained succession?

**Arch:** Document everything. The code speaks.

---

## Meeting 521: The Archive Trigger

**Nova:** When do we archive?

**PM:** Triggers:
- Teams discontinues web version
- Electron becomes unmaintainable
- User count below 1000
- No maintainer for 1 year

**Nova:** Fair criteria.

---

## Meeting 522: The Microsoft Watch

**Nova:** We're safe.

---

- Proof that simple works
- Template for wrapper apps
- Community-driven sustainability

---

## Meeting 526: The Alternative History

**Nova:** What if Simple hadn't joined at meeting 101?

**Arch:** We'd have 15,000 lines of TypeScript and 20 dependencies.

**Nova:** And burnout.

**Arch:** Probably.

---

## Meeting 527: The Principle Preservation

**Nova:** How do we preserve principles after us?

**Arch:** They're in the code. They're in the docs. They're in the culture.

**Nova:** Cultures can change.

**Arch:** That's okay. Every generation interprets.

---

## Meeting 528: The Exit Interview

**PM:** If we sunset, what's the message?

**Nova:**
```
Teams for Linux served the Linux community for 10 years.
The codebase is preserved. Fork freely.

---
