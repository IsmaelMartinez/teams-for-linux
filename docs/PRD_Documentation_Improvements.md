# Product Requirements Document: Documentation Improvements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive initiative to improve the existing documentation within the `teams-for-linux` project. The goal is to enhance clarity, completeness, and accessibility for both new and existing contributors, as well as users seeking troubleshooting information.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this documentation improvement initiative are:

*   **Improve Developer Onboarding:** Reduce the time and effort required for new contributors to understand the project's architecture, code structure, and development patterns.
*   **Enhance Code Maintainability:** Provide clear references for internal APIs, configurations, and module interactions, making it easier for developers to make changes and debug issues.
*   **Reduce Support Burden:** Offer comprehensive troubleshooting guides and FAQs to empower users to resolve common issues independently.
*   **Increase Code Quality:** Encourage better coding practices through consistent JSDoc and clearer module responsibilities.
*   **Foster Collaboration:** Facilitate smoother collaboration by providing a single source of truth for project knowledge.

## 3. Scope

This initiative will focus on the following key areas of documentation:

### 3.1. Configuration Documentation

*   **Description:** Create a dedicated document detailing all application configuration options.
*   **Content:**
    *   List all properties within `appConfig.startupConfig` and `settingsStore`.
    *   Specify data types for each property.
    *   Provide default values.
    *   Clearly explain the purpose and impact of each configuration option on application behavior.
    *   Include examples where applicable.
*   **Location:** `docs/configuration.md`

### 3.2. Module-Level Details and Interactions

*   **Description:** Enhance existing `README.md` files within `app/` subdirectories and create new ones where missing.
*   **Content:** For each module:
    *   A concise summary of the module's primary responsibility.
    *   Its public API (exported functions, classes, and their purpose).
    *   Key dependencies and other modules it interacts with.
    *   Any specific patterns, conventions, or design decisions relevant to the module.
    *   Consider simple flowcharts or sequence diagrams for complex interactions.
*   **Location:** Within each `app/` subdirectory (e.g., `app/browser/README.md`, `app/config/README.md`).

### 3.3. Troubleshooting and FAQ

*   **Description:** Expand the existing `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` or create a new, more general troubleshooting guide.
*   **Content:**
    *   Common installation issues across different platforms/packages.
    *   Frequent runtime errors and their potential causes/solutions.
    *   How to collect debug logs and other diagnostic information.
    *   Answers to frequently asked questions by users and developers.
    *   **Targeted Issue Analysis:** Review issues from the last year, prioritizing those with keywords indicating solutions or high engagement, to extract concrete troubleshooting steps and workarounds. Focus on the most frequent categories identified in the issue analysis report (e.g., Installation/Update, UI/UX, Audio/Video, Performance/Stability, Screen Sharing, Login/Authentication).
*   **Location:** Expand `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` or create `docs/troubleshooting.md`.

### 3.4. Knowledge Base Improvements

*   **Description:** Leverage the collected GitHub issues data to create a comprehensive knowledge base of common problems and their solutions.
*   **Content:**
    *   Analysis of the most frequently reported issues and their resolutions.
    *   Pattern recognition of recurring problems across different user environments.
    *   Documented workarounds and solutions derived from successful issue resolutions.
    *   Cross-referencing of related issues to provide comprehensive context.
    *   Integration of community-contributed solutions and best practices.
*   **Location:** `docs/knowledge-base.md` or enhancement of existing `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

### 3.5. Code-Level Comments and JSDoc

*   **Description:** Apply code comments and JSDoc sparingly, focusing on areas where the code's intent is not immediately obvious, or where design decisions are unusual, rare, or strange.
*   **Content:**
    *   Comments should explain *why* a particular approach was taken, especially for complex algorithms, workarounds, or non-standard implementations.
    *   JSDoc should be used for public APIs (exported functions/classes) to define parameters, return values, and types, ensuring clarity for module consumers.
    *   Avoid redundant comments that merely restate what the code already clearly expresses.
*   **Implementation:** Incremental adoption during new feature development and bug fixes, with a focus on high-value comments that add significant clarity.

### 3.6. Visual Aids (Architecture Diagrams)

*   **Description:** Create high-level architecture diagrams to provide a visual overview of the system.
*   **Content:**
    *   Block diagrams illustrating the main Electron process, renderer processes, and key modules.
    *   Diagrams showing the flow of data and control between major components.
*   **Location:** `docs/architecture/` (new directory)

### 3.7. API Documentation (IPC Channels)

*   **Description:** Centralize and document all Inter-Process Communication (IPC) channels.
*   **Content:**
    *   A comprehensive list of all `ipcMain.on` and `ipcMain.handle` channels.
    *   For each channel: its purpose, expected input parameters (types and structure), and the structure of its return values.
    *   Examples of usage from both the main and renderer processes.
*   **Location:** `docs/ipc-api.md`

## 4. Success Metrics

The success of this initiative will be measured by:

*   **Reduction in Common Questions:** A decrease in recurring questions on GitHub issues, forums, or internal communication channels related to configuration, module usage, or common errors.
*   **Faster Onboarding:** Anecdotal feedback from new contributors indicating a smoother and quicker understanding of the codebase.
*   **Increased Documentation Coverage:** Quantitative metrics (e.g., number of documented configuration options, modules with detailed READMEs, JSDoc coverage percentage).
*   **Positive Developer Feedback:** Surveying developers on the usefulness and clarity of the new documentation.

## 5. Out of Scope

The following items are considered out of scope for this specific initiative:

*   Full external user guides or end-user facing manuals (beyond troubleshooting).
*   Marketing or promotional materials.
*   Automated documentation generation tools (unless explicitly integrated as part of JSDoc implementation).

## 6. High-Level Timeline

*   **Phase 1: Planning & Template Creation (1 week)**
    *   Finalize documentation structure and templates.
    *   Define JSDoc standards.
*   **Phase 2: Core Documentation Creation (4-6 weeks)**
    *   Create `docs/configuration.md`.
    *   Initial pass on `app/` module READMEs.
    *   Draft `docs/troubleshooting.md` (In Progress - initial content added).
    *   Create knowledge base from GitHub issues analysis data.
    *   Create initial architecture diagrams.
    *   Document core IPC channels.
*   **Phase 3: Incremental JSDoc & Refinement (Ongoing)**
    *   Integrate JSDoc into new code and during bug fixes/refactoring.
    *   Continuously update and refine all documentation based on feedback and code changes.

## 7. Stakeholders

*   **Project Maintainers:** Responsible for guiding the initiative and ensuring quality.
*   **Current Contributors:** Will benefit from clearer documentation and contribute to its creation.
*   **New Contributors:** Will have a smoother onboarding experience.
*   **Users:** Will benefit from improved troubleshooting resources.
