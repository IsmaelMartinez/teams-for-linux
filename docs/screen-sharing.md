# Screen Sharing in Teams for Linux

Teams for Linux provides robust screen sharing capabilities that integrate seamlessly with the Microsoft Teams web interface while maintaining the security benefits of Electron's contextIsolation and sandbox features.

## How It Works

### User Experience Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User starts screen sharing in Teams] --> B{Screen sharing request}
    B --> C[Stream Selector opens]
    C --> D[User selects screen/window]
    D --> E[Popup thumbnail window opens]
    E --> F[Screen sharing active]
    F --> G{User action}
    
    G -->|Click stop in Teams| H[Screen sharing ends]
    G -->|Close preview window| I[Screen sharing stops]
    G -->|End Teams call| J[Screen sharing stops]
    
    H --> K[Preview window closes]
    I --> K
    J --> K
    K --> L[Back to normal state]

    style E fill:#c8e6c9
    style K fill:#ffcdd2
```

### What You'll See

1. **Stream Selector Window**: When you start screen sharing, a selection dialog appears showing:
   - Available screens (monitors)
   - Open application windows
   - Preview thumbnails of each option

2. **Preview Window**: Once sharing begins, a small floating window appears showing:
   - Live preview of what you're sharing
   - Always stays on top (configurable)
   - Resizable but maintains aspect ratio
   - Can be manually closed to stop sharing

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

```mermaid

    subgraph "Teams Web App (Renderer)"
        A[Teams PWA] --> B[getDisplayMedia Call]
        B --> C[Injection Script Hook]
    end
    
    subgraph "Main Process"
        E[setDisplayMediaRequestHandler] --> F[Stream Selector]
        F --> G[Desktop Capturer]
        G --> H[Source Selection]
        H --> I[ScreenSharingManager]
        D --> I
        I --> J[Preview Window Instance]
    end
    
    subgraph "UI Detection (Renderer)"
        K[Button Monitoring] --> L[Stop Sharing Detected]
        L --> M[IPC: screen-sharing-stopped]
        M --> N[Cleanup & Close Preview]
    end

### Component Interaction Flow

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant T as Teams App
    participant I as Injection Script
    participant M as Main Process
    participant S as Stream Selector
    participant P as Preview Window
    
    U->>T: Click "Share screen"
    T->>T: Call getDisplayMedia()
    
    Note over T,M: Dual Detection System
    T->>I: Hook detects call
    T->>M: setDisplayMediaRequestHandler
    
    M->>S: Show source selector
    S->>U: Display available screens/windows
    U->>S: Select source
    S->>M: Return selected source
    
    M->>M: Store screen sharing state
    M->>P: Create preview window
    P->>U: Show thumbnail preview
    
    Note over U,P: Screen sharing active
    
    alt User stops via Teams UI
        U->>T: Click "Stop sharing"
        I->>I: Detect stop button click
        I->>M: screen-sharing-stopped
    else User closes preview
        U->>P: Close window
        P->>P: Window cleanup
    end
    
    M->>M: Cleanup sharing state
    M->>P: Close preview window
    P->>U: Preview disappears
```

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Screen Sharing Thumbnail

```json
{
  "screenSharingThumbnail": {
    "enabled": true,
    "alwaysOnTop": true
  }
}
```

- `enabled`: Whether to show the preview thumbnail window (default: `true`)
- `alwaysOnTop`: Keep preview window above other windows (default: `true`)

## Window Lifecycle Management

### Preview Window States

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed: Initial state
    Closed --> Creating: User starts sharing
    Creating --> Open: Window created successfully
    Open --> Active: Screen sharing confirmed
    Active --> Closing: Stop sharing initiated
    Active --> Closing: User closes window
    Active --> Closing: Call/session ends
    Closing --> Closed: Cleanup complete
    Closed --> [*]
    
    Creating --> Error: Creation failed
    Error --> Closed: Fallback
```

### Automatic Cleanup Scenarios

The preview window automatically closes when:

1. **User stops sharing via Teams**: Stop button click detected
2. **User closes preview manually**: Window close event
3. **Teams call ends**: Session termination detected
4. **Application shutdown**: Process cleanup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Preview Window Doesn't Appear
**Symptoms**: Screen sharing works but no thumbnail preview shows
**Causes**:
- `screenSharingThumbnail.enabled` is `false`
- Window creation failed due to system restrictions

**Solutions**:
```json
{
  "screenSharingThumbnail": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

#### Preview Window Won't Close
**Symptoms**: Preview remains open after sharing stops
**Causes**: IPC communication issues between renderer and main process

**Solutions**:
1. Manually close the preview window
2. Restart Teams for Linux
3. Check system logs for IPC errors

#### Screen Sharing Stops Unexpectedly
**Symptoms**: Sharing ends without user action
**Causes**: Usually related to system permissions or resource limits

**Solutions**:
1. Check screen capture permissions (macOS/Linux)
2. Verify no conflicting screen capture software
3. Monitor system resources

#### Multiple Preview Windows
**Symptoms**: Several preview windows appear for one sharing session
**Causes**: Duplicate window creation (should be fixed in current version)

**Solutions**: 
1. Update to latest version
2. Close extra windows manually
3. Report as bug if persists

### Debug Information

To troubleshoot screen sharing issues:

1. **Enable debug logging**:
```json
{
  "logConfig": {
    "transports": {
      "console": {
        "level": "debug"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Check IPC events**: Look for these debug messages:
   - `Screen sharing started`
   - `Creating preview window for screen sharing`
   - `Screen sharing stopped`
   - `Preview window closed`

3. **System information**: Note your platform (X11/Wayland/macOS) as different code paths are used

## Security Considerations

### Context Isolation Compatibility

Teams for Linux screen sharing is designed to work with Electron's security features:

- **Context Isolation**: ✅ Fully supported via `contextBridge` API
- **Sandbox**: ✅ Compatible with renderer process sandboxing
- **Node Integration**: ❌ Not required (disabled by default)

### Permissions Required

#### Linux
- **X11**: Screen capture via standard X11 protocols
- **Wayland**: PipeWire desktop portal access

#### macOS
- **Screen Recording**: System permission required
- **Camera/Microphone**: For audio sharing (optional)

#### Windows
- **Desktop Capture**: Built-in Windows APIs

## Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Control

For developers integrating with Teams for Linux:

```javascript
// Check if screen sharing is active
const isActive = await electronAPI.getScreenSharingStatus();

// Get current sharing details
const sourceId = await electronAPI.getScreenShareStream();
const screenConfig = await electronAPI.getScreenShareScreen();

// Stop sharing programmatically (if accessible)
electronAPI.stopSharing();
```

### Custom Integration

The screen sharing system exposes several IPC channels for custom integration:

- `screen-sharing-started`: Notification when sharing begins
- `screen-sharing-stopped`: Notification when sharing ends

See [`ipc-api.md`](ipc-api.md) for complete API documentation.
