# teams-for-linux

Unofficial Microsoft Teams client for Linux using Electron. This app wraps the
web version of Teams as a standalone desktop application.

## Overview

Teams for Linux was developed to provide a native-like desktop experience by
wrapping the web version in an Electron shell.

While we strive to add useful features and improvements, some limitations are
inherent because the app relies on the Microsoft Teams web version. In cases
where Microsoft controls the feature set (or behavior), issues may be closed
with an explanation.

We are not affiliated with Microsoft, and this project is not endorsed by them.
It is an independent effort to provide a better experience for Linux users.

Please report bugs and enhancements in the issues section. We will attend them
as soon as possible. Please review the open/close issues before raising a new
one and avoid duplicates. We encourage everyone to join our chat room in
[matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#teams-for-linux_community:gitter.im) and ask your
questions. That's probably the quickest way to find solutions.
