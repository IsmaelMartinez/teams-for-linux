# Custom CSS

This folder contains all the handlers and helpers to be able to provide custom css to teams-for-linux

This is applied using config options.

You can currently either use customCSSLocation or customCSSName.

The customCSSLocation will load the css from that location. This should be a full path.

The current options for customCSSName are "compactDark", "compactLight", "tweaks", "condensedDark" and "condensedLight". Those have been pick up from [https://userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org)

Check [#77](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/77) for more information about it and how to integrate further styles.

Further information about config options can be found in the [config README.md file](../config/README.md).
