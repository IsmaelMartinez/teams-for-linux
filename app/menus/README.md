# Menus

This folder handles the menus (tray and main menu).

To access the main menu, press the 'Alt' key while the application is selected.

[index.js](index.js) is the entry point. That loads the different files in this folder that define each menu and submenu items.

*    Application Menu: The [appMenu.js](appMenu.js) file contains the submenu for the application tab. This submenu definition is also in use for the tray menu.
*    Tray: [tray.js](tray.js) contains the tray menu and its implementation.
