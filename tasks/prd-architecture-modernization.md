# Product Requirements Document: Architecture Modernization

<!-- toc -->

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the investigation and planning phase for restructuring the Teams for Linux repository into a domain-driven architecture. The current codebase mixes concerns across the monolithic `app/index.js` file, making it challenging to maintain, test, and onboard new contributors. This modernization effort aims to establish clear domain boundaries, improve code organization, and create a foundation for future scalability while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Goals

1. **Inventory and analyze** the current module structure and dependencies to understand the existing architecture
2. **Define and evaluate** multiple repository structure options (layered, feature-based, domain-driven, plugin-based)
3. **Recommend an optimal structure** with detailed migration plan, focusing on domain-driven design with bounded contexts
4. **Create comprehensive documentation** including architecture diagrams, migration checklist, and risk mitigation strategies
5. **Establish a foundation** for improved testability, maintainability, and developer onboarding experience

## User Stories

- **As a new contributor**, I want to easily understand the codebase structure so that I can start contributing quickly without getting lost in mixed concerns
- **As a maintainer**, I want clearly separated domains so that I can modify notification logic without affecting authentication or screen sharing functionality
- **As a developer**, I want to add new features (like in-app docs) without worrying about breaking existing functionality due to tight coupling
- **As a project lead**, I want a migration plan that minimizes breaking changes so that existing workflows and integrations remain stable

## Functional Requirements

### Investigation Phase
1. The system must **inventory all existing modules** in the `app/` directory and document their current responsibilities and dependencies
2. The system must **map current IPC communication patterns** to understand inter-module communication requirements
3. The system must **identify shared state and global variables** that need to be properly encapsulated
4. The system must **analyze the current configuration management** through `AppConfiguration` class usage patterns

### Architecture Design Phase
5. The system must **define clear domain boundaries** for core domains: Shell (Electron lifecycle), Core (Teams integration), Integrations (system notifications, tray), and UI Support (themes, custom CSS)
6. The system must **create architectural diagrams** showing proposed domain relationships and communication patterns
7. The system must **evaluate multiple structural approaches** and score them against maintainability, testability, and simplicity criteria
8. The system must **design internal plugin patterns** that establish extension points for future community contributions, using a graduated approach starting with internal modularity

### Planning Phase
9. The system must **create a detailed migration plan** with specific phases and milestones that maintain backward compatibility
10. The system must **document all identified risks** and provide specific mitigation strategies for each
11. The system must **establish success metrics** focused on code simplicity rather than complex KPIs
12. The system must **create a workspace skeleton** showing the proposed directory structure and module organization

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **File movement or code refactoring**: This is investigation and planning only; no actual code migration will occur
- **Breaking changes to existing APIs**: All current functionality must remain accessible during and after migration
- **Performance optimization**: Focus is on structure, not performance improvements
- **Adding new features**: The scope is limited to reorganizing existing functionality
- **Immediate testing framework integration**: Testing will be addressed in a separate phase after restructuring to avoid over-complicating the initial architecture design

## Technical Considerations

### Existing Solutions Research

**Similar Electron Applications:**
- **VS Code**: Uses a layered architecture with clear separation between core, workbench, and extensions
- **Discord**: Employs a modular approach with domain-specific modules and event-driven communication
- **Figma Desktop**: Implements a plugin system with strict boundaries between core and extensions

**Build vs. Buy Analysis:**
- **Build**: Custom domain-driven structure tailored to Teams for Linux requirements
  - Pros: Perfect fit for current needs, full control, no vendor dependencies
  - Cons: Requires more initial effort, ongoing maintenance responsibility
- **Existing Frameworks**: Electron app organization frameworks (e.g., electron-webpack, electron-forge)
  - Pros: Established patterns, community support
  - Cons: May not align with domain-driven goals, potential over-engineering

**Recommendation**: Build custom domain-driven structure, as the application's specific requirements (Teams integration, system-level features) don't align well with generic frameworks.

### Architecture Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing Electron APIs and IPC patterns
- Should work within current build pipeline (`electron-builder`, GitHub Actions, Docusaurus deployment)
- Must support existing configuration system (`AppConfiguration` class as cross-cutting concern)
- Should accommodate current browser injection patterns in `app/browser/tools/`
- IPC patterns will be migrated gradually as domains are established (no immediate centralized event bus)
- Documentation should integrate with Docusaurus platform and AI Research section structure

### Domain Boundaries (Proposed)
1. **Shell Domain**: Electron lifecycle, single instance management, command-line processing
2. **Core Domain**: Teams integration, main window management, authentication
3. **Integration Domain**: System notifications, tray management, desktop environment integration
4. **UI Support Domain**: Themes, custom CSS, custom backgrounds, browser tools

## Success Metrics

### Simplicity-Focused Metrics
- **Reduced file complexity**: Target maximum 300 lines per module file (currently `app/index.js` exceeds 1000+ lines)
- **Clear module boundaries**: Each module should have a single, clearly defined responsibility
- **Simplified onboarding**: New contributors should be able to understand a domain's purpose within 15 minutes of reading its README
- **Dependency clarity**: Module dependencies should form a directed acyclic graph with no circular references

### Qualitative Success Indicators
- Architecture diagrams are intuitive to junior developers
- Migration plan steps are actionable and specific
- Risk mitigation strategies are practical and testable
- Documentation explains "why" decisions were made, not just "what" was decided

## Design Considerations

### Documentation Structure
- Use Docusaurus's native Mermaid support for architecture diagrams showing domain relationships
- Employ GitHub alert syntax for important migration warnings and notes (supported in Docusaurus)
- Create collapsible sections for detailed technical specifications using Docusaurus admonitions
- Include relative links between related documentation files within the Docusaurus site structure
- Leverage AI Research section in `docs-site/docs/ai-research/` for strategic architectural analysis

### Migration Approach
- Conservative, backward-compatible approach with gradual transition
- Phase-based implementation with clear rollback strategies
- Maintain existing functionality throughout all migration phases
- Document every step with before/after examples
- Strategic architecture analysis documents in Docusaurus AI Research section to track design decisions during migration

## Architectural Decisions

Based on project requirements and stakeholder input, the following decisions have been made:

### Testing Integration
**Decision**: Testing framework will be introduced in a separate phase after domain restructuring is complete. This avoids over-complicating the initial architecture design and allows domains to be established based on business logic rather than testing constraints.

### Plugin System Approach
**Decision**: Graduated plugin system starting with internal modularity patterns, then expanding to community contributions. This establishes solid extension points within the codebase before opening to external developers.

### Configuration Management
**Decision**: `AppConfiguration` will remain as a cross-cutting concern accessed by all domains through a centralized service. This maintains the current successful pattern while allowing domain-specific access facades.

### IPC Migration Strategy
**Decision**: IPC patterns will be migrated gradually as domains are established. Each domain will handle its own IPC patterns organically rather than implementing a centralized event bus immediately.

### Documentation Strategy
**Decision**: Strategic architecture analysis documents will be created in the Docusaurus AI Research section (`docs-site/docs/ai-research/`) to track major design decisions during migration, providing historical context while leveraging the enhanced documentation platform and automated deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> This PRD focuses on investigation and planning only. Implementation will be addressed in subsequent PRDs once the architectural foundation is established and approved.

> [!WARNING]
> Any migration must maintain full backward compatibility. Breaking changes are explicitly out of scope for this modernization effort.
