# PRD: Context Isolation and Sandbox Security Configuration

<!-- toc -->

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD addresses the urgent need to disable Electron's `contextIsolation` and `sandbox` security features in Teams for Linux to restore critical DOM event listening functionality. **CRITICAL**: The current ReactHandler implementation will break completely when Microsoft Teams updates to the next React version (expected within 6-12 months), making this a survival strategy rather than an optimization choice.

This document outlines a two-phase emergency approach: **Phase 1** - Restore current functionality via DOM access (immediate user needs), **Phase 2** - Implement Microsoft Graph API fallback system (mandatory for long-term survival when React internals change).

The primary goal is to buy time with DOM access while building the API solution that will become mandatory when Microsoft's React update breaks current functionality.

## Goals

1. **Phase 1 - DOM Access Restoration** (Immediate): Disable contextIsolation/sandbox to restore current Teams for Linux functionality and buy time for API development
2. **Phase 2 - API Fallback Development** (Critical): Build Microsoft Graph API polling system as mandatory fallback for when React internals break (6-12 months)
3. **ReactHandler Obsolescence Planning**: Document breaking changes and timeline for when current DOM access will fail completely
4. **User Migration Strategy**: Create smooth transition path from DOM-based features to API-based alternatives when React update occurs
5. **Security Risk Mitigation**: Implement compensating security controls while contextIsolation/sandbox are disabled

## User Stories

**Primary Developer Story:**
- As a Teams for Linux developer, I want to access Microsoft Teams DOM events and data so that I can build integrations and features that enhance the user experience with the Teams web interface.

**Secondary Stories:**
- As a developer, I want to understand all available Microsoft Teams API options so that I can choose the most secure and scalable approach for event listening.
- As a developer, I want to implement the most secure solution possible while maintaining full functionality for Teams integration features.
- As a project maintainer, I want to make an informed decision about security trade-offs based on comprehensive API research and cost analysis.

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1: API Research and Evaluation (Priority 1)

1. **Microsoft Graph Teams API Investigation**
   - Research all available Microsoft Graph Teams APIs for real-time event access
   - Document webhook subscription capabilities and limitations
   - Identify change notification endpoints relevant to Teams events
   - Test API response times and real-time capabilities

2. **Scaling and Pricing Analysis**
   - Calculate pricing for 1 million user scenarios across different API usage patterns
   - Document rate limiting constraints (currently 50 RPS per app per tenant)
   - Evaluate subscription limits (max 650 users per presence subscription)
   - Assess billing model requirements (Azure subscription setup)

3. **API Coverage Assessment**
   - Map current DOM event access to equivalent API endpoints
   - Identify feature gaps between DOM access and API capabilities
   - Document any functionality that cannot be replicated via APIs

4. **User Opt-In Model Design**
   - Design user configuration system for optional API integration
   - Create setup documentation for Azure app registration and API keys
   - Document user-provided credential configuration process
   - Plan fallback mechanisms when API access is not configured

5. **Technical Feasibility Study**
   - Evaluate polling strategies suitable for desktop applications
   - Assess authentication and permission requirements for Teams APIs  
   - Document integration complexity compared to current DOM approach
   - Analyze real-time capability limitations vs DOM access

### Phase 2: Implementation Decision (Priority 2)

6. **Decision Framework**
   - Create evaluation criteria matrix (cost, security, functionality, maintenance)
   - Compare API approach vs. contextIsolation/sandbox disabling
   - Document recommendation with supporting analysis

7. **Implementation Path Selection**
   - If APIs are viable: Create user opt-in API integration plan with setup documentation
   - If APIs are insufficient: Proceed with security configuration changes plus enhanced protections
   - Design hybrid approach: API integration for users who opt-in, DOM access as fallback

### Phase 3: Security Configuration (If Required)

8. **Electron Security Configuration**
   - Disable `contextIsolation` in affected BrowserWindow instances
   - Disable `sandbox` mode where DOM access is required
   - Document specific renderer processes affected

9. **Compensating Security Controls**
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions
   - Add input validation and sanitization for DOM interactions
   - Establish secure communication patterns between main and renderer processes
   - Implement runtime security monitoring and logging

### Phase 4: User Opt-In API Integration (Alternative/Hybrid Approach)

10. **User Configuration System**
   - Add configuration options for user-provided Microsoft Graph API credentials
   - Create setup wizard or documentation for Azure app registration
   - Implement credential validation and testing functionality
   - Add fallback logic when API credentials are not configured

11. **API Integration with User Credentials**
   - Implement Microsoft Graph API client using user-provided tokens
   - Create webhook endpoint system (optional, user-hosted or cloud service)
   - Add API-based event listening as alternative to DOM access
   - Document user setup requirements and limitations

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Immediate Security Changes**: Will not disable contextIsolation/sandbox until API research is complete
- **Comprehensive Security Audit**: This PRD does not cover full security review of the entire application
- **Alternative Electron Frameworks**: Will not evaluate switching to different Electron alternatives
- **Multi-Platform Security**: Focus is on current Linux implementation, not Windows/macOS variations
- **Legacy Code Migration**: Will not refactor existing non-security related code during this implementation

## Technical Considerations

### Microsoft Teams API Research Findings

Based on initial research, Microsoft Graph Teams APIs offer several relevant capabilities:

**Available APIs:**
- **Change Notifications**: Webhook subscriptions for Teams resources with rate limiting (50 RPS per app per tenant)
- **Presence API**: Real-time user status with subscription limits (650 users per subscription, 1-hour max expiration)
- **Meeting Events**: Real-time meeting start/end and participant events through bot framework
- **Message Notifications**: Teams chat and channel message webhooks

**Pricing Structure (As of 2024) - User Opt-In Model:**
- Many Teams APIs transitioned from metered billing (effective August 2025, no longer metered)
- **User Responsibility**: Teams for Linux users provide their own Microsoft Graph API credentials and handle billing
- **User Setup**: Users create Azure app registration and manage their own API costs (if any)
- **Fallback Option**: DOM access remains available for users who don't configure API access
- Rate limits: 50 RPS global limit, additional per-resource limits (1 RPS per app per tenant per resource)

**Technical Limitations:**
- Webhook subscription validation required
- Maximum subscription lifetime requires renewal management
- Authentication complexity (app registration, permissions, tenant approval)
- Potential latency compared to direct DOM access

### Security Risk Assessment

**Current Risks with contextIsolation/sandbox disabled:**
- Renderer processes have full Node.js API access
- Potential for malicious code injection through Teams web content
- Reduced isolation between web content and system resources
- Increased attack surface for privilege escalation

**Proposed Mitigations:**
- Implement strict Content Security Policy headers
- Add runtime monitoring for suspicious DOM interactions
- Restrict Node.js API access to specific, required functions only
- Implement secure IPC patterns with input validation
- Regular security audits of DOM interaction code

### Implementation Architecture

**API-First Approach (Preferred):**
```
Teams for Linux → Microsoft Graph API → Teams Data
                ↓
        Webhook Endpoints ← Real-time Events
```

**DOM Access Approach (Fallback):**
```
Teams for Linux → Electron Renderer → Teams DOM
     ↓                    ↓
Security Controls    Event Listeners
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Research Completeness**: 100% coverage of relevant Microsoft Graph Teams APIs documented and evaluated
2. **Cost Analysis Accuracy**: Precise pricing calculations for 1M user scenarios with ±10% accuracy
3. **Functionality Parity**: Document percentage of current DOM event functionality replicable via APIs
4. **Decision Timeline**: Complete API research and provide implementation recommendation within research phase
5. **Security Enhancement**: If contextIsolation disabled, implement at least 3 compensating security controls
6. **Performance Baseline**: API response times ≤ 200ms for critical event notifications
7. **Scalability Validation**: Confirm API approach can handle 1M+ user scenarios within rate limits

## Open Questions

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Can Microsoft Graph API rate limits (50 RPS) support real-time event needs for large user bases?
2. **Enterprise Licensing**: What are the exact licensing requirements for third-party Teams applications using Graph APIs at scale?
3. **Webhook Infrastructure**: What infrastructure requirements exist for hosting webhook endpoints reliably?
4. **Feature Completeness**: Which specific DOM events/data cannot be accessed through current Microsoft Graph APIs?
5. **Migration Timeline**: If APIs are adopted, what is the realistic timeline for migrating away from DOM access?
6. **Hybrid Approach**: Is a combination of APIs (where available) and limited DOM access (where necessary) feasible?
7. **Microsoft Roadmap**: Are there planned API expansions that could address current functionality gaps?
8. **Security Certification**: Do any enterprise customers require specific security certifications that would be affected by contextIsolation changes?

> [!NOTE]
> This PRD prioritizes API research over immediate security configuration changes, aligning with the principle of making informed decisions based on comprehensive evaluation of alternatives.

> [!WARNING]
> Disabling contextIsolation and sandbox significantly reduces Electron's security posture. This should only be considered after thorough API evaluation confirms no viable alternatives exist.
