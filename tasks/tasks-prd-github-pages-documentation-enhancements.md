# Tasks: GitHub Pages Documentation Enhancements

<!-- toc -->

## System Analysis

### ADR Review

- **No Architecture Decision Records found** - The `docs/adr/` directory does not exist in this project
- **No conflicts identified** - No existing architectural decisions constrain documentation enhancement choices
- **Implementation freedom** - Can proceed with documentation enhancements without constraint conflicts

### Documentation Review

- **Current GitHub Pages deployment** - Successfully deployed from `/docs` folder with basic Jekyll theme
- **13 documentation files** - Comprehensive content covering user guides, developer docs, and troubleshooting  
- **Mermaid diagrams present** - Currently showing as raw code, need proper rendering support
- **Mobile experience** - Basic responsive design, needs enhancement for modern mobile experience
- **No search functionality** - Users must manually browse to find information
- **Integration points identified**:
  - Current GitHub Pages deployment works but has enhancement opportunities
  - Documentation structure suitable for in-app integration planning
  - Content organization good foundation for enhanced navigation

### Pattern Analysis

- **GitHub Pages constraints** - Must work within supported Jekyll plugins and themes
- **Minimal setup preference** - Avoid complex build processes, enhance current system  
- **Content structure preservation** - Maintain existing docs organization and workflow
- **Research-driven approach** - Need comprehensive platform evaluation before implementation
- **Future integration planning** - Design decisions should consider in-app documentation potential

### Conflicts and Constraints

- **GitHub Pages plugin limitations** - Restricted to supported Jekyll plugins for search and enhanced features
- **No native search support** - GitHub Pages doesn't include built-in search functionality
- **Theme restrictions** - Limited to supported themes or remote themes with basic customization
- **Mermaid diagram support** - Not natively supported, requires client-side rendering solution
- **Build complexity constraint** - Must maintain simple deployment process

### Research Spikes Identified

- **Documentation platform comparison** - Evaluate MkDocs, enhanced Jekyll themes, and Docusaurus options
- **GitHub Pages search solutions** - Research client-side search implementations compatible with static sites
- **Mobile-first design patterns** - Identify best practices for documentation mobile experience
- **Mermaid diagram rendering** - Find solutions for proper diagram display in GitHub Pages
- **Theme evaluation** - Compare supported themes and remote theme options for enhanced features
- **Performance impact assessment** - Ensure enhancements don't negatively impact site performance

## Relevant Files

- `docs/_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration file (to be created for theme and plugin settings)
- `docs/_includes/` - Directory for reusable components (to be created)
- `docs/_layouts/` - Directory for page layouts (to be created for custom layouts)
- `docs/assets/js/` - Directory for JavaScript files including search functionality
- `docs/assets/css/` - Directory for custom CSS and theme overrides
- `docs/*.md` - All existing documentation files (structure preserved)
- `docs/ai-research/*.md` - Subdirectory documentation files (structure preserved)
- `.github/workflows/` - Existing CI/CD workflows (no modifications needed for basic enhancements)

### Notes

- Focus on enhancements that work within GitHub Pages constraints
- Prioritize client-side solutions for advanced features like search
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing documentation links
- Plan for future in-app integration without immediate implementation
- Follow established patterns of minimal maintenance overhead
