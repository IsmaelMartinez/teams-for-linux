<!-- toc -->

## System Analysis

### ADR Review

- **No Architecture Decision Records found** - The `docs/adr/` directory does not exist in this project
- **No conflicts identified** - No existing architectural decisions constrain documentation enhancement choices
- **Implementation freedom** - Can proceed with documentation enhancements without constraint conflicts

### Documentation Review

- **Current GitHub Pages deployment** - Successfully deployed from `/docs` folder with basic Jekyll theme (will be replaced by Docusaurus)
- **13 documentation files** - Comprehensive content covering user guides, developer docs, and troubleshooting  
- **Mermaid diagrams present** - Will be properly rendered with Docusaurus
- **Mobile experience** - Will be enhanced with Docusaurus's responsive design
