# Tasks: GitHub Pages Documentation Enhancements

<!-- toc -->

## System Analysis

### ADR Review

- **No Architecture Decision Records found** - The `docs/adr/` directory does not exist in this project
- **No conflicts identified** - No existing architectural decisions constrain documentation enhancement choices
- **Implementation freedom** - Can proceed with documentation enhancements without constraint conflicts

### Documentation Review

- **Current GitHub Pages deployment** - Successfully deployed from `/docs` folder with basic Jekyll theme (will be replaced by Docusaurus)
- **13 documentation files** - Comprehensive content covering user guides, developer docs, and troubleshooting  
- **Mermaid diagrams present** - Will be properly rendered with Docusaurus
- **Mobile experience** - Will be enhanced with Docusaurus's responsive design
- **No search functionality** - Will be implemented with Docusaurus's built-in search
- **Integration points identified**:
  - Docusaurus will provide enhanced GitHub Pages deployment
  - Documentation structure suitable for in-app integration planning
  - Content organization good foundation for enhanced navigation

### Pattern Analysis

- **GitHub Pages constraints** - Docusaurus is compatible with GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
- **Automated build process** - Docusaurus introduces a build process, automated via GitHub Actions
- **Content structure preservation** - Maintain existing docs organization and workflow (migration to Docusaurus structure)
- **Platform evaluation completed** - Docusaurus selected as the enhanced documentation platform
- **Future integration planning** - Design decisions will consider in-app documentation potential with Docusaurus

### Conflicts and Constraints

- **GitHub Pages compatibility** - Docusaurus works with GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
- **Built-in search** - Docusaurus provides built-in search functionality
- **Flexible theming** - Docusaurus offers extensive theming and customization
- **Mermaid diagram support** - Docusaurus supports client-side rendering for Mermaid diagrams
- **Automated build process** - Docusaurus introduces a build process, automated via GitHub Actions

### Research Spikes Identified

- **Documentation platform selected** - Docusaurus chosen after comprehensive comparison
- **Search solution identified** - Docusaurus's built-in search (often Algolia-based)
- **Mobile-first design patterns** - Best practices analyzed and will be applied with Docusaurus
- **Mermaid diagram rendering** - Docusaurus supports client-side rendering
- **Theme evaluation completed** - Docusaurus theme will be customized
- **Performance impact assessment** - Will be conducted during Docusaurus prototype development

## Relevant Files

- `docs-site/` - New directory for the Docusaurus project
- `docs-site/docusaurus.config.js` - Docusaurus configuration file
- `docs-site/src/pages/` - Directory for React pages
- `docs-site/src/components/` - Directory for React components
- `docs-site/docs/` - Directory for Markdown/MDX documentation files
- `docs-site/static/` - Directory for static assets
- `docs-site/blog/` - Directory for blog posts (if used)
- `docs-site/sidebars.js` - Docusaurus sidebar configuration
- `docs-site/package.json` - Docusaurus project dependencies
- `docs/*.md` - Existing documentation files (will be migrated to `docs-site/docs/`)
- `docs/ai-research/*.md` - Existing subdirectory documentation files (will be migrated to `docs-site/docs/ai-research/`)
- `.github/workflows/` - Existing CI/CD workflows (will be updated for Docusaurus build and deploy)

### Notes

- Focus on Docusaurus capabilities within GitHub Pages constraints
- Leverage Docusaurus's built-in features for search and navigation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing documentation links
- Plan for future in-app integration with Docusaurus's static output
- Follow established patterns of automated deployment and maintainability
