# Product Requirements Document: Token Cache Authentication Fix

<!-- toc -->

## Introduction/Overview

Teams for Linux users experience frequent authentication interruptions requiring manual re-login approximately every 24 hours, after system sleep/wake cycles, and after application restarts. This problem occurs because the Electron wrapper lacks a proper token cache interface, preventing Microsoft Teams' authentication provider from performing silent token refresh despite having valid refresh tokens stored in localStorage.

The web version of Microsoft Teams works flawlessly in browsers due to native session/cache handling, but our Electron implementation is missing the token cache abstraction layer that the Teams authentication provider expects.

**Goal**: Eliminate authentication interruptions for Teams for Linux users through a two-phase iterative approach: immediate relief via token cache bridge, followed by enterprise-grade secure token storage.

## Goals

1. **Immediate Relief (Phase 1)**: Eliminate 24-hour re-authentication prompts within 3-5 days
2. **System Resilience (Phase 1)**: Maintain authentication through sleep/wake cycles and app restarts  
3. **Long-term Security (Phase 2)**: Implement OS-backed secure token storage following industry best practices
4. **Zero User Friction**: Solution works transparently without requiring user configuration
5. **Maintainable Architecture**: Clean, well-documented implementation that survives Teams updates

## User Stories

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix
- **As a Teams for Linux user**, I want to use Teams for multiple days without re-entering my credentials, so that I can focus on work instead of authentication interruptions
- **As a remote worker**, I want my authentication to persist when my laptop goes to sleep, so that I don't lose productivity when returning to work
- **As a developer using Teams**, I want authentication to survive application restarts during development/updates, so that my workflow isn't interrupted

### Phase 2: Secure Enhancement  
- **As an enterprise user**, I want my authentication tokens stored securely using OS-level encryption, so that my corporate access remains protected even if my device is compromised
- **As a security-conscious user**, I want tokens stored in the system keychain rather than plain text, so that malware cannot easily steal my authentication credentials

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1: Token Cache Bridge (Days 1-5)

1. **Create LocalStorage Token Cache Bridge**: System must provide a token cache interface that wraps existing localStorage token storage
2. **Runtime Cache Injection**: System must safely inject the token cache into Teams' authentication provider during application initialization
3. **Silent Token Refresh**: System must enable automatic token renewal without user interaction when refresh tokens are available
4. **Token Expiration Handling**: System must properly handle token expiration scenarios and gracefully fallback to interactive authentication when necessary
5. **Cross-Session Persistence**: Token cache must maintain authentication state across application restarts
6. **Sleep/Wake Resilience**: Token cache must survive system sleep and hibernation cycles
7. **Error Recovery**: System must implement robust error handling with fallback to interactive authentication

### Phase 2: Secure Token Storage (Days 6-15)

8. **OS-Backed Storage Integration**: System must implement secure token storage using platform-native credential stores (Keychain/Windows Vault/Secret Service)
9. **Token Migration**: System must automatically migrate existing localStorage tokens to secure storage without user intervention
10. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Secure storage must work consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows
11. **Encryption at Rest**: All stored tokens must be encrypted using OS-level cryptographic APIs
12. **Token Lifecycle Management**: System must properly handle token creation, renewal, expiration, and deletion in secure storage

### Diagnostic & Maintenance

13. **PII-Safe Logging**: System must provide diagnostic logging that excludes token values and personally identifiable information
14. **Configurable Debug Output**: System must allow enabling/disabling detailed authentication diagnostics via configuration
15. **Token Health Monitoring**: System must log token cache operations for troubleshooting without exposing sensitive data

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Custom MSAL Integration**: Will not implement Microsoft Authentication Library requiring developer app registration
- **Token Value Modification**: Will not alter or intercept actual token values, only provide cache interface
- **Browser-Specific Features**: Will not attempt to replicate browser-only authentication features
- **Backward Compatibility Breaking**: Will not modify existing user data or configuration file formats
- **Real-time Token Monitoring**: Will not implement continuous token validation or real-time expiry notifications

## Design Considerations

### Phase 1: Minimal UI Impact
- Solution operates entirely in background with no UI changes required
- Existing authentication flows remain unchanged from user perspective
- Error states gracefully fallback to current re-authentication behavior

### Phase 2: Progressive Enhancement
- Secure storage migration happens transparently on first launch
- No additional user configuration or setup required
- Visual indicators for authentication status remain consistent

## Technical Considerations

### Phase 1 Implementation
- **Token Cache Interface**: Implement cache bridge matching Teams authentication provider expectations
- **Injection Timing**: Hook into authentication provider initialization without breaking existing flows
- **localStorage Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing token storage format
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement try/catch blocks to prevent authentication system crashes

### Phase 2 Implementation  
- **Storage Library Selection**: Evaluate keytar vs Electron safeStorage for optimal cross-platform support
- **Migration Strategy**: One-time migration from localStorage to secure storage with rollback capability
- **Performance Impact**: Minimize encryption/decryption overhead for token operations
- **Platform Dependencies**: Handle platform-specific keychain integration requirements

### Security Considerations
- **Token Key Sanitization**: Remove specific token identifiers from diagnostic logs
- **Access Control**: Ensure only application processes can access stored tokens
- **Cleanup on Uninstall**: Properly remove tokens when application is uninstalled

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria
1. **Zero Re-authentication for 48+ Hours**: Users can use Teams continuously for at least 48 hours without manual login
2. **Sleep/Wake Success Rate**: 100% authentication retention after system sleep cycles lasting 1+ hours
3. **Restart Persistence**: Authentication survives application restarts in 100% of test cases
4. **Performance Baseline**: No measurable impact on application startup time (<100ms overhead)

### Monitoring & Validation
- Diagnostic logs show successful silent token refresh operations
- Error rates for authentication failures decrease to <1% of current levels
- User reports of re-authentication prompts eliminated
- No increase in authentication-related support requests

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Token Cache Bridge (Week 1)
- **Days 1-2**: Research and implement localStorage cache bridge
- **Day 3**: Runtime injection and integration testing
- **Days 4-5**: Comprehensive testing and validation

### Phase 2: Secure Storage (Week 2-3)  
- **Days 6-8**: Secure storage implementation and platform testing
- **Days 9-10**: Token migration logic and backward compatibility
- **Days 11-12**: Cross-platform validation and performance testing
- **Days 13-15**: Final integration testing and documentation

### Deployment Strategy
- **Direct to Main**: Deploy to main branch after comprehensive testing
- **Beta Testing Period**: 1-week internal testing before release
- **Release Notes**: Clear communication about authentication improvements

## Open Questions

1. **Token Format Changes**: How should we handle potential changes in Teams token format during updates?
2. **Migration Failure Recovery**: What fallback mechanism should exist if secure storage migration fails?
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Should we implement metrics collection for token cache performance?
4. **Enterprise Policies**: How should the solution interact with enterprise device management policies?
5. **Debug Mode Control**: Should diagnostic logging be controllable via command-line flags or configuration files?

## Risk Mitigation

### Phase 1 Risks
- **Teams Updates Breaking Integration**: Implement defensive coding and version detection
- **Cache Injection Failures**: Provide fallback to current authentication behavior
- **localStorage Corruption**: Implement cache validation and recovery mechanisms

### Phase 2 Risks  
- **Platform Keychain Issues**: Thoroughly test across all supported platforms
- **Migration Data Loss**: Implement backup and rollback mechanisms
- **Performance Degradation**: Benchmark and optimize encryption operations

> [!NOTE]
> This PRD assumes implementation by developers familiar with the Teams for Linux codebase. All token handling must comply with Microsoft's authentication policies and maintain existing security boundaries.

> [!WARNING]  
> Phase 1 implementation should be considered a temporary solution. Phase 2 secure storage is essential for production deployment in enterprise environments.
