# Task List: Architecture Modernization

## System Analysis

### ADR Review

- **No ADR directory found**: The project does not currently have an `docs/adr/` directory, indicating that Architecture Decision Records are not yet in use
- **Decision**: Strategic architecture analysis documents will be created in the Docusaurus AI Research section to track design decisions during migration
- **Alignment**: This leverages the existing AI Research documentation pattern established in `docs-site/docs/ai-research/` and supports automated deployment

### Documentation Review

- **Docusaurus Migration**: Project has migrated to Docusaurus platform in `docs-site/` directory with automated GitHub Pages deployment
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Both legacy `docs/README.md` and new `docs-site/docs/index.md` contain Mermaid diagrams showing current architecture
- **IPC Documentation**: `docs-site/docs/ipc-api.md` provides comprehensive mapping of current IPC channels - critical for domain boundary planning
- **Configuration Guide**: `docs-site/docs/configuration.md` documents how `AppConfiguration` class is used across the system
- **AI Research Section**: New `docs-site/docs/ai-research/` directory established for strategic analysis documents
- **Deployment Automation**: GitHub Actions workflow (`docs.yml`) automatically deploys Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages
- **Enhanced Features**: Docusaurus provides search, mobile-first design, Mermaid diagram support, and accessibility features

### Pattern Analysis

- **Current Architecture**: Monolithic `app/index.js` (1000+ lines) handles configuration, IPC registration, state management, and lifecycle
- **Module Structure**: Existing modules in `app/` directory show domain-like organization but are not consistently structured
- **IPC Patterns**: Mix of `ipcMain.on` (fire-and-forget) and `ipcMain.handle` (request-response) patterns throughout codebase
- **Configuration Pattern**: Centralized `AppConfiguration` class used as cross-cutting concern - successful pattern to maintain
- **State Management**: Global variables (`userStatus`, `idleTimeUserStatus`) need encapsulation within domain boundaries

### Conflicts and Constraints

- **No Breaking Changes**: All current IPC channels and APIs must remain functional during and after migration
- **Configuration Dependency**: All domains currently depend on centralized config - must maintain access patterns
- **Build Pipeline**: Must work within current `electron-builder` and GitHub Actions setup including new Docusaurus documentation workflow
- **Testing Gap**: No existing test framework means domains must be designed to be testable when testing is later introduced
- **Documentation Platform Alignment**: New ADRs and architectural documentation should integrate with Docusaurus platform rather than legacy docs structure

### Research Spikes Identified

- **VS Code Architecture Study**: Investigate how VS Code structures domains with clear separation between core, workbench, and extensions
- **Discord Desktop Architecture**: Research Discord's modular approach and event-driven communication patterns
- **Electron IPC Best Practices**: Study large-scale Electron apps for IPC organization patterns
- **Domain Boundary Validation**: Prototype domain separation with one existing module to validate approach
- **Configuration Access Patterns**: Design domain-specific config access without breaking centralized management

## Relevant Files

### Investigation Phase
- `app/index.js` - Main analysis target for refactoring (1000+ lines, central coordination)
- `docs/README.md` - Update architecture diagrams to reflect new domain structure
- `docs/ipc-api.md` - Map IPC channels to appropriate domains during migration
- `package.json` - Document any new dependencies or build script changes

### Planning Phase
- `docs-site/docs/ai-research/architecture-modernization-analysis.md` - Architecture modernization strategic analysis
- `docs-site/docs/ai-research/domain-boundary-analysis.md` - Domain boundary research and validation
- `docs-site/sidebars.ts` - Update navigation to include architecture documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Update with new architectural patterns and development guidelines

### Domain Structure (Future)
- `app/shell/` - Electron lifecycle, single instance, command-line processing
- `app/core/` - Teams integration, main window management, authentication  
- `app/integrations/` - System notifications, tray, desktop environment
- `app/ui-support/` - Themes, custom CSS, custom backgrounds, browser tools
- `app/shared/` - Cross-domain utilities and interfaces

### Testing Preparation
- `app/shell/index.test.js` - Future test files for domain modules
- `app/core/index.test.js` - Future test files for domain modules
- `app/integrations/index.test.js` - Future test files for domain modules
- `app/ui-support/index.test.js` - Future test files for domain modules

### Notes

- Testing framework will be introduced after domain restructuring to avoid over-complicating initial design
- All current functionality must remain accessible during migration phases
- Focus on business logic-driven domain boundaries rather than technical layer separation
- Strategic architecture analysis documents in Docusaurus AI Research section will track major decisions without heavy process overhead
