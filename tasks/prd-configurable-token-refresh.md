# Product Requirements Document: Configurable Token Refresh

<!-- toc -->

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enhances the existing Teams for Linux token cache system by adding configurable token refresh strategies. Currently, Teams uses a standard refresh pattern (refreshing ~1 hour before token expiry), which can still lead to authentication interruptions during network changes or extended sessions. 

The configurable token refresh feature will provide proactive token refresh capabilities, allowing tokens to be refreshed at regular intervals regardless of their expiry time, preventing authentication interruptions and improving user experience during network transitions, sleep/wake cycles, and extended usage sessions.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate authentication interruptions** by proactively refreshing tokens before network or system state changes
2. **Provide configurable refresh strategies** to accommodate different user preferences and usage patterns  
3. **Enhance existing token cache system** without disrupting current functionality
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing Teams authentication behavior
5. **Keep implementation simple** and maintainable with minimal configuration overhead

## User Stories

1. **As a mobile professional**, I want my Teams authentication to refresh proactively every hour so that I don't get "Please sign in again" prompts when switching between train wifi networks
2. **As a power user**, I want to configure my token refresh interval so that I can optimize for my specific usage patterns (frequent vs. infrequent Teams usage)
3. **As a system administrator**, I want Teams for Linux to maintain authentication persistently so that users don't experience productivity interruptions
4. **As a developer**, I want the token refresh system to use existing authentication infrastructure so that it's reliable and doesn't conflict with Teams' built-in mechanisms

## Functional Requirements

1. **The system must support two refresh strategies**: "standard" (current Teams behavior) and "proactive" (configurable interval-based refresh)
2. **The system must default to "proactive" strategy** with a 1-hour refresh interval
3. **The system must allow configuration of refresh interval** in hours via the application configuration file
4. **The system must refresh the main authentication token** (ic3.teams.office.com) used for Teams communication
5. **The system must enhance existing refresh logic** rather than creating a separate refresh system
6. **The system must maintain existing token cache functionality** without breaking changes
7. **The system must log refresh activities** using the existing `[TOKEN_CACHE]` logging prefix for debugging
8. **The system must handle refresh failures gracefully** by falling back to standard Teams refresh behavior
9. **The system must integrate with the existing TeamsTokenCache class** in tokenCache.js
10. **The system must be configurable only through the configuration file** (no UI components required)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Refresh notifications or user alerts** - refresh should be silent
2. **Manual refresh hotkeys or UI controls** - automation only
3. **Multiple resource refresh** - only the main authentication token (not Graph API, SharePoint, etc.)
4. **Retry logic beyond basic error handling** - rely on existing Teams fallback mechanisms
5. **Telemetry and diagnostics beyond logging** - use existing logging infrastructure
6. **Advanced scheduling or network-aware refresh** - simple time-based intervals only
7. **Settings UI integration** - configuration file only

## Design Considerations

### Configuration Structure
```javascript
// In appConfiguration
{
  "tokenRefresh": {
    "strategy": "proactive",        // "standard" | "proactive"
    "refreshIntervalHours": 1       // Number (only used when strategy is "proactive")
  }
}
```

### Integration Points
- Extend existing `TeamsTokenCache` class in `app/browser/tools/tokenCache.js`
- Use existing `ReactHandler` token refresh mechanism discovered in debugging
- Leverage existing configuration system in `app/appConfiguration/`

## Technical Considerations

### Build vs. Buy Analysis
**Build internally** - No existing solutions needed as this enhances the current token cache system we've already implemented. The feature builds directly on proven working token refresh mechanisms discovered during implementation.

### Implementation Approach
1. **Extend TeamsTokenCache class** with refresh scheduling methods
2. **Enhance existing refresh logic** rather than creating new authentication flows
3. **Use existing ReactHandler.triggerTokenRefresh()** method as the foundation
4. **Integrate with current appConfiguration** system for settings
5. **Maintain existing logging patterns** for consistency

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing token cache system (already implemented)
- ReactHandler token refresh capability (already working)
- AppConfiguration system (already available)
- Teams authentication provider access (already established)

### Architecture Cleanup Requirements
1. **Remove debug functionality**: Clean up `window.teamsDebug` exposure and console debugging
2. **Refactor debug code into production methods**: Convert working refresh logic into proper class methods
3. **Organize refresh logic appropriately**: Move refresh scheduling into TeamsTokenCache class
4. **Integrate with configuration system**: Add proper configuration validation and defaults
5. **Maintain existing patterns**: Follow established logging, error handling, and module organization patterns

## Success Metrics

1. **Reduce authentication interruption reports** - Users should experience fewer "Please sign in again" prompts
2. **Maintain authentication persistence** - Token cache hit ratio should remain high (>95%)
3. **Zero breaking changes** - Existing functionality continues to work for users who don't enable proactive refresh
4. **Successful proactive refreshes** - When enabled, tokens should refresh successfully at configured intervals
5. **No performance degradation** - Refresh scheduling should not impact application performance

## Open Questions

1. **Should the refresh interval be configurable at runtime** or only at application startup?
2. **What should be the minimum allowed refresh interval** to prevent excessive API calls?
3. **Should we validate the refresh interval value** and provide warnings for very frequent intervals?
4. **How should configuration validation errors be handled** (fall back to defaults vs. prevent startup)?

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Foundation (Release Current Work)
- Complete and release existing secure token cache implementation
- Commit working token injection and storage functionality
- Ensure stable baseline before adding refresh scheduling

### Phase 2: Selective Integration (New Branch)
- Create new feature branch: `feature/configurable-token-refresh`
- Cherry-pick only the working refresh logic from debug implementation
- Leave debug code and experimental features behind

### Phase 3: Production Implementation
- Extend TeamsTokenCache class with refresh scheduling
- Integrate configuration system
- Clean up debug code into production methods
- Add proper error handling and logging

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Test proactive refresh functionality
- Validate configuration options
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Verify no performance impact
