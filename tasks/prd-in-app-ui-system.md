# Product Requirements Document: In-App UI System

## Introduction/Overview

This feature will create an integrated user interface system within Teams for Linux that provides users with easy access to application configuration, troubleshooting resources, and help documentation without leaving the application. The system will use an overlay/modal approach that sits on top of the Teams interface, offering power users comprehensive configuration management and all users searchable access to the knowledge base and help content.

## Goals

1. **Improve User Discoverability**: Make configuration options and help resources easily accessible from within the application
2. **Enhance Power User Experience**: Provide comprehensive configuration editing capabilities through an intuitive interface
3. **Reduce Configuration Barriers**: Enable users to modify settings without manually editing JSON files
4. **Integrate Knowledge Base Access**: Bring the rich documentation ecosystem directly into the user workflow
5. **Create Contextual Help System**: Provide searchable, immediately accessible troubleshooting assistance
6. **Maintain Application Flow**: Ensure the UI doesn't disrupt the primary Teams functionality

## User Stories

### Primary Users (Power Users)
- **As a power user managing multiple Teams profiles**, I want to quickly access and modify configuration settings so that I can optimize my setup for different work contexts
- **As an advanced user troubleshooting issues**, I want to search the knowledge base while keeping Teams open so that I can apply solutions without context switching
- **As a user configuring custom CSS or backgrounds**, I want a visual interface to manage these settings so that I don't have to manually edit configuration files
- **As a system administrator deploying Teams for Linux**, I want to understand all available configuration options so that I can create optimal default configurations

### Secondary Users (All Users)
- **As a new user**, I want to discover available features and settings so that I can customize my Teams experience
- **As a user experiencing problems**, I want immediate access to troubleshooting guides so that I can resolve issues quickly
- **As a casual user**, I want to find help without needing to visit external documentation sites

### Tertiary Users (Contributors)
- **As a developer**, I want users to have easy access to configuration options so that support requests decrease
- **As a maintainer**, I want the UI to guide users toward self-service solutions

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Overlay/Modal System
- The system must provide a keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+H) to open the help overlay
- The system must include a menu item in the application menu for accessing the UI

- The system must display troubleshooting guides with step-by-step instructions
- The system must provide quick access to common solutions and command examples
- The system must link related help topics and cross-references
- The system must support markdown rendering for rich content display

### 5. User Interface Design
- The system must use a distinct design that clearly separates from Teams interface
- The system must provide clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation
- The system must include consistent styling across all panels and sections
- The system must support dark/light mode preferences
- The system must provide clear indicators for unsaved changes
- The system must include loading states and error handling

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Real-time collaboration features or multi-user configuration editing
- Cloud synchronization of settings across devices
- Advanced scripting or automation capabilities
- Integration with external configuration management systems
- Custom theme/CSS editor with live preview
- Plugin or extension system for third-party additions
- Advanced analytics or usage tracking within the UI
- Integration with Microsoft Teams admin center or policies

## Design Considerations

### User Interface Architecture
```
Overlay System
├── Main Navigation (tabs/sidebar)
│   ├── Configuration Manager
│   ├── Knowledge Base Search
│   ├── Troubleshooting Guides
│   └── About/System Info
├── Content Area (context-dependent)
└── Action Bar (save, cancel, reset)
```

### Configuration Management Layout
- **Category-based organization**: Group related settings logically
- **Search/filter capability**: Quick access to specific settings
- **Visual indicators**: Show which settings differ from defaults
- **Import/Export tools**: Backup and share configurations
- **Validation feedback**: Real-time error checking and warnings

### Knowledge Base Integration
- **Unified search interface**: Single search box across all content
- **Content categorization**: Filter by problem type, difficulty, etc.
- **Quick access panels**: Most common issues prominently displayed
- **Progressive disclosure**: Summary → Details → Full documentation flow

### Modal/Overlay Behavior
- **Non-blocking operation**: Teams remains functional underneath
- **Persistent state**: Remember user's position and open sections
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full accessibility support
- **Responsive design**: Adapt to different screen sizes and orientations

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Architecture

**Frontend Components:**
- **Overlay Manager**: Controls modal display, positioning, and lifecycle
- **Configuration Engine**: Handles reading, validation, and writing of config files
- **Search Engine**: Indexes and searches documentation content
- **Content Renderer**: Displays markdown and handles rich content
- **State Manager**: Manages UI state and user preferences

**Technology Integration:**
- **Electron BrowserWindow**: Overlay rendering within main application window
- **React/Preact**: Component-based UI framework for maintainable interface
- **Monaco Editor**: Advanced text editing for configuration values
- **Lunr.js/Fuse.js**: Client-side full-text search capabilities
- **Marked/Unified**: Markdown parsing and rendering

### IPC Communication Requirements
- **Configuration read/write**: Secure communication with main process for file operations
- **Application state**: Access to current app configuration and status
- **Documentation content**: Load and index help content from docs directory
- **Search operations**: Efficient content searching and result delivery

### Data Processing Workflow
```
User Opens UI → Load Current Config → Render Interface → 
User Makes Changes → Validate Input → Preview Changes → 
Apply Configuration → Update Files → Refresh Application State
```

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Configuration System**: Extend existing AppConfiguration class for UI integration
- **Documentation**: Leverage existing docs/ structure and markdown content
- **Menu System**: Integrate with existing application menu for access
- **IPC Handlers**: Create new channels for UI-specific operations

## Open Questions

1. **Configuration Scope**: Should the UI support all configuration options or focus on the most commonly accessed settings initially?

2. **Real-time Application**: Which configuration changes can be applied immediately vs. requiring application restart?

3. **Advanced Features**: Should complex features like custom CSS editing be included in the initial release or added later?

4. **Content Updates**: How should the UI handle updates to documentation content - automatic refresh or manual reload?

5. **User Preferences**: Should the UI remember user preferences (open sections, search history, etc.) and where should this data be stored?

6. **Error Recovery**: How should the UI handle configuration errors or corrupted settings files?

7. **Offline Support**: Should the UI work completely offline or require internet access for some features?

8. **Platform Integration**: Should the UI follow platform-specific design guidelines (Windows/Linux/macOS) or maintain consistent cross-platform appearance?
