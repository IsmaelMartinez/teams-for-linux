## System Analysis

### ADR Review

- No Architecture Decision Records found in `docs/adr/`.

### Documentation Review

- `docs/configuration.md`: Relevant for understanding existing configuration management.
- `docs/ipc-api.md`: Relevant for defining new IPC channels for communication between main and renderer processes.
- `app/appConfiguration/index.js`: Centralized configuration management.
- `app/mainAppWindow/index.js`: Manages the main `BrowserWindow`.
- `app/browser/tools/`: Client-side scripts injected into the Teams web interface.

### Pattern Analysis

- **Modularity:** New features should be placed in separate, dedicated modules.
- **Modernization:** Use `async/await`, `const`/`let`, and class private fields.
- **Robustness:** Comprehensive error handling, structured logging.
- **IPC Communication:** Moving towards a centralized event bus or IPC abstraction layer. New IPC channels should be well-documented.
- **Configuration Management:** All configuration is managed through `AppConfiguration` class; treat as immutable after startup.
- **State Management:** Avoid global variables; use dedicated state management modules.

### Conflicts and Constraints

- None identified for this specific module yet.

### Research Spikes Identified

- None identified for this specific module yet.

## Relevant Files

- `app/inAppUI/`: New module for the in-app UI and separate window.
- `app/inAppUI/index.js`: Main entry point for the in-app UI module.
- `app/inAppUI/inAppUI.html`: HTML for the in-app UI modal.
- `app/inAppUI/inAppUI.css`: Custom styles for the in-app UI modal.
- `app/inAppUI/preload.js`: Preload script for the in-app UI modal.
- `app/index.js`: Main Electron process, will need modifications for IPC handlers and potentially window management.
- `app/menus/appMenu.js`: Menu definition for adding the "In-App UI" entry.
- `app/menus/index.js`: Menu handling logic, will need to call the new in-app UI module.
- `docs/ipc-api.md`: Will need to be updated with new IPC channels.
- `app/mainAppWindow/index.js`: May need to interact with the new separate window.
- `app/browser/tools/`: Potential location for scripts injected into the Teams web app to facilitate video/toolbar integration.
- `app/appConfiguration/index.js`: Will need to be updated to include configuration options for the separate window (e.g., auto-pop).

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- Follow established patterns identified in the Pattern Analysis section
- Address any conflicts noted in the System Analysis before implementation

## Tasks

- [ ] 3.0 Integrate Configuration Management Interface
  - [ ] 3.1 Design and implement the UI for displaying all current configuration settings.
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement input controls (text fields, checkboxes, dropdowns, file pickers) for modifying configuration values.
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement validation of configuration changes before applying them.
  - [ ] 3.4 Implement saving changes to the appropriate configuration files.
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement reset-to-defaults option for each configuration section.
  - [ ] 3.6 Implement configuration export/import functionality.
  - [ ] 3.7 Handle configuration reload without requiring application restart where possible.

## Future Improvements

This section captures enhancements and non-critical features that could be implemented after the core functionality is complete:

### Priority 2 (Nice-to-Have)

- **Custom CSS/Background Management UI:** A visual interface to manage custom CSS or backgrounds, as mentioned in the PRD.
- **Real-time Preview of Changes:** For configuration changes, provide a real-time preview where applicable.
- **Contextual Help System:** Provide searchable, immediately accessible troubleshooting assistance based on the current context within the application.

### Priority 3 (Future Consideration)

- **Advanced Scripting/Automation:** Explore possibilities for advanced scripting or automation capabilities within the UI.
- **Plugin/Extension System:** Consider a system for third-party additions to the in-app UI.
- **Advanced Analytics/Usage Tracking:** Implement analytics within the UI to track feature usage and effectiveness (with user consent).

### Technical Debt Considerations

- **Centralized IPC Abstraction:** Refactor existing IPC handling in `app/index.js` towards a more centralized event bus or IPC abstraction layer.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Introduce a formal testing framework and build a comprehensive test suite for the new in-app UI modules.
- **Error Handling Refinement:** Implement a more robust and consistent error handling strategy across all new modules.
