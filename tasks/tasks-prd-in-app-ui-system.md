## System Analysis

### ADR Review

- No Architecture Decision Records found in `docs/adr/`.

### Documentation Review

- `docs/configuration.md`: Relevant for understanding existing configuration management.
- `docs/ipc-api.md`: Relevant for defining new IPC channels for communication between main and renderer processes.
- `app/appConfiguration/index.js`: Centralized configuration management.
- `app/mainAppWindow/index.js`: Manages the main `BrowserWindow`.
- `app/browser/tools/`: Client-side scripts injected into the Teams web interface.

### Pattern Analysis

- **Modularity:** New features should be placed in separate, dedicated modules.
- **Modernization:** Use `async/await`, `const`/`let`, and class private fields.
- **Robustness:** Comprehensive error handling, structured logging.
- **IPC Communication:** Moving towards a centralized event bus or IPC abstraction layer. New IPC channels should be well-documented.
- **Configuration Management:** All configuration is managed through `AppConfiguration` class; treat as immutable after startup.
- **State Management:** Avoid global variables; use dedicated state management modules.

### Conflicts and Constraints

- None identified for this specific module yet.

### Research Spikes Identified

- None identified for this specific module yet.

## Relevant Files

- `app/inAppUI/`: New module for the in-app UI and separate window.
- `app/inAppUI/index.js`: Main entry point for the in-app UI module.
- `app/inAppUI/inAppUI.html`: HTML for the in-app UI modal.
- `app/inAppUI/inAppUI.css`: Custom styles for the in-app UI modal.
- `app/inAppUI/preload.js`: Preload script for the in-app UI modal.
- `app/index.js`: Main Electron process, will need modifications for IPC handlers and potentially window management.
- `app/menus/appMenu.js`: Menu definition for adding the "In-App UI" entry.
- `app/menus/index.js`: Menu handling logic, will need to call the new in-app UI module.
- `docs/ipc-api.md`: Will need to be updated with new IPC channels.
- `app/mainAppWindow/index.js`: May need to interact with the new separate window.
- `app/browser/tools/`: Potential location for scripts injected into the Teams web app to facilitate video/toolbar integration.
- `app/appConfiguration/index.js`: Will need to be updated to include configuration options for the separate window (e.g., auto-pop).

### Notes

- Follow established patterns identified in the Pattern Analysis section
- Address any conflicts noted in the System Analysis before implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Implement Core In-App UI Modal (About/System Info)
  - [x] 1.1 Add a close button to the `inAppUI.html` modal
  - [x] 1.2 Implement dismissal of the modal via Escape key and clicking outside.
  - [x] 1.3 Implement keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+H) to open the modal.
  - [x] 1.4 Ensure the modal is responsive across different screen sizes.
  - [x] 1.5 Add basic styling to align with the project's aesthetic.
- [ ] 2.0 Refine User Interface Design and Accessibility
  - [ ] 2.1 Ensure distinct design that clearly separates from Teams interface.
  - [ ] 2.2 Provide clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation.
  - [ ] 2.3 Ensure consistent styling across all panels and sections.
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement dark/light mode preferences.
  - [ ] 2.6 Implement loading states and error handling.
  - [ ] 2.7 Ensure full keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.


## Future Improvements

This section captures enhancements and non-critical features that could be implemented after the core functionality is complete:


- **Attach/Detach Functionality:** Allow users to attach or detach the in-app UI from the main Teams window.


### Technical Debt Considerations

- **Centralized IPC Abstraction:** Refactor existing IPC handling in `app/index.js` towards a more centralized event bus or IPC abstraction layer.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Introduce a formal testing framework and build a comprehensive test suite for the new in-app UI modules.
- **Error Handling Refinement:** Implement a more robust and consistent error handling strategy across all new modules.
