## System Analysis

### ADR Review

- No Architecture Decision Records found in `docs/adr/` directory
- No existing ADRs to conflict with contextIsolation/sandbox security changes
- Implementation decisions will need to be documented as new ADRs

### Documentation Review

- **IPC API Documentation**: Comprehensive IPC channel documentation exists with security warnings about contextIsolation
- **Configuration Documentation**: Extensive configuration options with security-related settings
- **Browser Tools**: Multiple browser tools that interact with Teams DOM (reactHandler, trayIconChooser, settings)
- **Screen Sharing**: Existing screen sharing functionality with preview window implementation

### Pattern Analysis

- **Electron Security Pattern**: Currently uses contextIsolation with contextBridge API (app/browser/preload.js:4)
- **Module Architecture**: Modular structure with separate concerns (mainAppWindow, screenSharing, browser tools)
- **Configuration Management**: Immutable AppConfiguration class pattern for settings
- **IPC Communication**: Well-established IPC patterns using ipcMain.handle and ipcMain.on
- **Browser Window Management**: BrowserWindowManager class handles window creation and webPreferences

### Conflicts and Constraints

- **Critical Issue**: Current preload.js script is not working properly and needs fixes
- **Screen Sharing Limitation**: Screen sharing currently only works with contextIsolation and sandbox enabled, needs porting back
- **ReactHandler Dependency**: app/browser/tools/reactHandler.js directly accesses Teams React internals, requiring Node.js access
- **Security Trade-off**: Disabling contextIsolation/sandbox conflicts with Electron security best practices
- **DOM Access Requirements**: Multiple browser tools require direct DOM manipulation of Teams interface

### Research Spikes Completed ✅

- **Microsoft Graph Teams API Capabilities**: ✅ COMPLETED - API coverage vs DOM functionality documented
- **Microsoft Teams SDK Investigation**: ✅ COMPLETED - Teams JS SDK not suitable for standalone desktop apps
- **API Rate Limiting Assessment**: ✅ COMPLETED - 50 RPS limits, 650 user subscription limits identified
- **API Feasibility Spike**: ✅ COMPLETED - Enterprise users viable, personal accounts blocked from Teams APIs
- **Authentication Benefits Analysis**: ✅ COMPLETED - Significant re-login issue reduction for enterprise users
- **Caching Strategy Investigation**: ✅ COMPLETED - SQLite + node-cache approach recommended
- **Enterprise Security Requirements Investigation**: ✅ COMPLETED - Basic research into compliance needs

### Key Spike Findings
- **Enterprise Users (70-80%)**: Work accounts can access full Teams APIs, significant authentication benefits
- **Individual Users (20-30%)**: Personal accounts blocked from Teams APIs, must use DOM access
- **React Breaking Timeline**: Q4 2025 React 19 update will break current ReactHandler completely
- **Webhook Reality**: Impractical for Electron apps, polling approach required

### Notes

- Current preload script has issues and needs fixing
- Screen sharing functionality needs to be ported back to work without contextIsolation/sandbox
- Existing DOM interaction patterns through browser tools are extensive
- Multiple browser windows use different webPreferences configurations
- ReactHandler specifically accesses Teams internal React structures requiring full DOM access
