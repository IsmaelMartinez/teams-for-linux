# Task List: Electron 38 Upgrade with Screensharing Simplification

This task list provides a step-by-step implementation guide for upgrading Teams for Linux from Electron 37.6.0 to Electron 38.2.1 while simplifying the screensharing architecture.

<!-- toc -->

## System Analysis

### ADR Review

**ADRs Found:**
- `docs-site/docs/adr/token-cache-secure-storage.md` - Token cache security implementation
- `docs-site/docs/adr/token-refresh-implementation.md` - Token refresh mechanism

**Relevance to this feature:** Neither ADR directly impacts the Electron upgrade or screensharing implementation. These are focused on authentication/token management which should remain unaffected by this change.

**Conflicts:** None identified. No existing ADRs conflict with the Electron upgrade or screensharing modernization.

### Documentation Review

**Affected Documentation:**
- `docs-site/docs/screen-sharing.md` - User-facing screen sharing documentation
- `docs-site/docs/ipc-api.md` - IPC channel reference documentation
- `app/screenSharing/README.md` - Technical architecture documentation for stream selector module

**Integration Points:**
- Main App Window (`app/mainAppWindow/`) - Manages BrowserWindow and registers `setDisplayMediaRequestHandler`
- Screen Sharing Module (`app/screenSharing/`) - Contains StreamSelector class and 9 implementation files
- IPC System (`app/security/ipcValidator.js`) - Validates allowed IPC channels including screensharing channels
- Browser Preload Scripts (`app/browser/preload.js`, `app/screenSharing/preload.js`) - Enable secure IPC communication

**Dependencies:**
- Preview window creation logic in `app/mainAppWindow/index.js` (lines 45-148)
- Stream selector integration in `app/mainAppWindow/index.js` (lines 196-200+)
- IPC channels: `get-desktop-capturer-sources`, `screen-sharing-started`, `screen-sharing-stopped`, `selected-source`, `close-view`

### Pattern Analysis

**Current Architectural Patterns:**

1. **Module Organization Pattern:**
   - Single responsibility modules in `app/` directory
   - Each module has its own subdirectory with README.md
   - Example: `app/screenSharing/`, `app/mainAppWindow/`, `app/security/`

2. **IPC Communication Pattern:**
   - `ipcMain.handle` for request-response (e.g., `get-desktop-capturer-sources`)
   - `ipcMain.on` for fire-and-forget events (e.g., `screen-sharing-started`)
   - All IPC channels validated through `app/security/ipcValidator.js` allowlist
   - Preload scripts expose APIs via `window.electronAPI` (note: contextIsolation disabled)

3. **BrowserWindow Management Pattern:**
   - Window creation in dedicated manager classes (e.g., `BrowserWindowManager`)
   - Window state managed via `electron-window-state` library
   - Security configuration centralized in window creation

4. **WeakMap for Private Fields:**
   - Current StreamSelector class uses WeakMap pattern for private fields:
     ```javascript
     let _StreamSelector_parent = new WeakMap();
     let _StreamSelector_window = new WeakMap();
     ```
   - Modern Electron supports JavaScript `#privateField` syntax (preferred for new code)

5. **Error Handling Pattern:**
   - Try-catch blocks with `electron-log` for structured logging
   - Graceful degradation with user feedback
   - Defensive programming for DOM changes (Teams interface)

**Similar Features in Codebase:**
- Preview Window creation (`createScreenSharePreviewWindow` in `app/mainAppWindow/index.js`) uses BrowserWindow with similar pattern to what we need for modal dialogs
- Incoming Call Toast (`app/incomingCallToast/`) demonstrates creating child windows with parent relationships

**Deviations to Note:**
- StreamSelector currently uses **WebContentsView** (line 58 in `app/screenSharing/index.js`) which is less common
- Uses `setBrowserView()` (line 86) which is deprecated but still functional
- The PRD calls for replacing WebContentsView with modal BrowserWindow, which aligns with the BrowserWindow pattern used elsewhere

### Conflicts and Constraints

**Identified Conflicts:**
1. **WebContentsView vs BrowserWindow Pattern:**
   - Current: StreamSelector uses `WebContentsView` added as child view to parent window
   - Desired: Modal `BrowserWindow` dialog pattern (consistent with rest of codebase)
   - Resolution: Replace WebContentsView with modal BrowserWindow during simplification

2. **Multiple IPC Event Registrations:**
   - Current: Uses `ipcMain.once()` for `selected-source` and `close-view` in StreamSelector.show()
   - Constraint: Each call to `show()` registers new listeners that auto-cleanup with `once()`
   - Risk: Potential for orphaned listeners if window closed abnormally
   - Resolution: Ensure proper cleanup in all code paths, consider using `ipcMain.handle` instead

3. **Security Configuration Constraint:**
   - **MUST maintain:** `contextIsolation: false`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: false`
   - Reason: Required for Teams DOM access (documented in CLAUDE.md and code comments)
   - Impact: Cannot modernize to contextBridge pattern for screensharing preload scripts
   - Mitigation: Existing CSP and IPC validation remain as compensating controls

**System Constraints:**
- Electron 38.x removes macOS 11 support → documentation must be updated
- Electron 38.x removes `ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT` → use `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` instead
- No automated tests → manual testing only (per PRD non-goal)
- Must maintain cross-platform compatibility (Linux priority, but macOS/Windows supported)

**Trade-offs:**
1. **Code consolidation vs file count:**
   - Focus: Simplify architecture and reduce complexity (primary goal)
   - File count reduction: Secondary benefit, not strict requirement
   - Approach: Consolidate duplicate logic, not necessarily merge all files

2. **IPC simplification vs functionality:**
   - Must preserve all functionality (thumbnails, preview, selection)
   - Can simplify IPC patterns (e.g., combine related channels) without removing features
   - Cannot break existing security validation

### Research Spikes Identified

> [!NOTE]
> No significant research spikes required for this implementation. All technologies and APIs are well-documented and currently in use.

**Minor Investigation Areas:**
1. **WebContentsView removal impact** - Quick code review to ensure no hidden dependencies (estimated: 30 minutes)
2. **Modal BrowserWindow behavior** - Verify modal dialogs work consistently across Linux/macOS/Windows (estimated: 1 hour during implementation)
3. **Electron 38.x changelog review** - Scan for any additional breaking changes not captured in migration analysis (estimated: 30 minutes)

**No Third-Party Evaluations Needed:**
- All dependencies (Electron, electron-builder, etc.) are existing and vetted
- No new libraries or services to evaluate
- Using existing Electron APIs only

### Phase 3: WebContentsView Replacement

- [x] 3.0 Replace WebContentsView with Modal BrowserWindow Pattern
  - [x] 3.1 Back up current `app/screenSharing/index.js` for reference (copy to `index.js.bak` temporarily)
  - [x] 3.2 Completely refactored `StreamSelector` class: replaced WeakMaps with native private fields (#parent, #window, #callback, #isClosing)
  - [x] 3.3 Rewrote `StreamSelector.show()` method: replaced `new WebContentsView()` with `new BrowserWindow()` using modal pattern
  - [x] 3.4 Configured modal BrowserWindow properties: `parent`, `modal: true`, `show: false`, `frame: true`, `skipTaskbar: true`, standard dimensions
  - [x] 3.5 Set webPreferences for stream selector window: `preload` path, `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: false`
  - [x] 3.6 Replaced `parent.contentView.addChildView(view)` with standard modal BrowserWindow pattern (no manual view management needed)
  - [x] 3.7 Removed `resizeView()` function and related resize event listeners (modal windows don't need manual resize like WebContentsView)
  - [x] 3.8 Created unified `#close()` private method: handles all cleanup (IPC listeners, callback execution, window destruction)
  - [x] 3.9 Implemented `#isClosing` flag guard: ensures callback only executes once regardless of execution path (IPC or closed event)
  - [x] 3.10 Updated `StreamSelector.show()` to use `window.once('ready-to-show', () => window.show())` pattern for smooth display
  - [x] 3.11 Test stream selector opening and closing without selecting a source (cancel scenario)
  - [x] 3.12 Test stream selector with screen selection and verify callback receives correct source
  - [x] 3.13 Test stream selector with window selection and verify callback receives correct source
  - [x] 3.14 Verify modal behavior: parent window should be disabled while stream selector is open
  - [x] 3.15 Run `npm run lint` to ensure code style compliance after refactoring
  - [x] 3.16 Code reduction: 142 lines → 83 lines (41% reduction), simplified architecture with native private fields

### Phase 4: IPC Simplification

- [x] 4.0 Simplify IPC Communication Patterns
  - [x] 4.1 Review current IPC usage: `ipcMain.once('selected-source')` and `ipcMain.once('close-view')` in StreamSelector
  - [x] 4.2 Evaluate whether `selected-source` and `close-view` can be consolidated into single channel or converted to `ipcMain.handle` pattern
  - [x] 4.3 **Decision: No changes needed** - Current IPC implementation already follows best practices
  - [x] 4.4 Verified `ipcMain.once()` auto-removes listeners after first use (correct pattern for modal dialogs)
  - [x] 4.5 Verified defensive cleanup with `removeAllListeners()` handles edge cases properly
  - [x] 4.6 Verified `#isClosing` guard prevents race conditions and double callback execution
  - [x] 4.7 Verified `contextBridge` with `contextIsolation: true` provides secure IPC exposure
  - [x] 4.8 Verified all IPC channels properly registered in `app/security/ipcValidator.js` allowlist
  - [x] 4.9 Testing confirmed: no orphaned listeners, clean startup/shutdown, no IPC warnings in console
  - [x] 4.10 No documentation updates needed - IPC channels remain unchanged

> [!NOTE]
> **Phase 4 Outcome:** After thorough analysis, the current IPC implementation already follows Electron best practices. The `ipcMain.once()` pattern with defensive cleanup and race condition guards is optimal for modal dialog scenarios. No changes were necessary.

## Future Improvements

This section captures enhancements and non-critical features that could be implemented after the core functionality is complete:

### Priority 2 (Nice-to-Have)

- **Modernize to `#private` fields** - ✅ COMPLETED in Phase 3 - StreamSelector now uses native private fields
- **Automated testing** - See comprehensive research in `docs-site/docs/research/automated-testing-strategy.md`
  - Recommended: Playwright for E2E + Vitest for unit/integration tests
  - Strategy for handling MS authentication via storage state reuse
  - 8-week incremental migration path to >70% coverage
- **Stream selector keyboard navigation** - Enhance UX with arrow key navigation and Enter/Escape shortcuts in stream selector
- **Stream selector search/filter** - Add search box to filter windows by name when many windows are open

### Priority 3 (Rejected / Not Viable)

- **Native system picker (`useSystemPicker`)** - ❌ REJECTED - See research in `docs-site/docs/research/usesystempicker-investigation.md`
  - Not supported on Linux Wayland/PipeWire (primary target platform)
  - macOS has known toggle-hang bugs
  - Complexity not justified given Linux blocker
  - Custom picker works reliably across all platforms

### Technical Debt Considerations

- **IPC security hardening** - Consider migrating to `contextIsolation: true` with contextBridge if Teams DOM access requirements change in future
- **Stream selector state management** - Refactor StreamSelector to use more robust state machine pattern for managing window lifecycle
- **Error boundary implementation** - Add comprehensive error handling and recovery for screensharing failures
- **Code duplication review** - Identify and consolidate any duplicate code between preview window and stream selector window creation
- **Electron API migration** - Monitor Electron deprecation warnings and proactively update APIs before they're removed in future versions
