# Product Requirements Document: Browser Module Loading Quick Fix

## Introduction/Overview

The Teams for Linux application is currently experiencing critical failures in browser module loading due to contextIsolation security constraints in Electron. Users are reporting broken notifications, non-functional browser features, and module loading errors that prevent essential functionality from working. This PRD outlines a quick fix approach to restore critical functionality with minimal architectural changes while maintaining stability.

## Goals

1. **Restore Critical Functionality**: Fix broken notifications and essential browser features immediately
2. **Minimize Risk**: Implement the smallest possible changes to avoid introducing new issues
3. **Maintain Compatibility**: Preserve all existing functionality without breaking current workflows
4. **Quick Deployment**: Enable rapid deployment to affected users with minimal testing overhead
5. **Bridge Solution**: Provide a stable foundation until larger architectural improvements can be implemented

## User Stories

1. **As an end user**, I want to receive Teams notifications so that I don't miss important messages and meetings
2. **As an end user**, I want zoom controls and keyboard shortcuts to work so that I can interact with Teams efficiently
3. **As an end user**, I want theme management to function so that Teams matches my system preferences
4. **As a developer**, I want the browser modules to load without errors so that debugging and development can continue normally
5. **As a maintainer**, I want a quick fix that doesn't require extensive testing so that users can get relief immediately

## Functional Requirements

### Core Browser Functionality (Must Have)
1. **FR-01**: The system must successfully load and initialize the preload script without module loading errors
2. **FR-02**: The system must support Teams notification functionality including desktop notifications and activity management
3. **FR-03**: The system must maintain tray icon updates and badge count functionality
4. **FR-04**: The system must preserve zoom controls (increase, decrease, reset zoom levels)
5. **FR-05**: The system must support basic keyboard shortcuts for navigation and zoom
6. **FR-06**: The system must maintain platform emulation for Teams compatibility
7. **FR-07**: The system must preserve title mutation detection for tray updates

### IPC Communication (Must Have)
8. **FR-08**: The system must maintain all existing IPC channels for main process communication
9. **FR-09**: The system must support configuration retrieval from the main process
10. **FR-10**: The system must preserve screen sharing and desktop capture APIs

### Error Handling (Must Have)
11. **FR-11**: The system must gracefully handle missing or failed module initialization
12. **FR-12**: The system must provide clear console logging for debugging purposes
13. **FR-13**: The system must not crash or prevent Teams loading if browser modules fail

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Complete architectural refactoring** - This will be addressed in a separate PRD for app re-architecture
2. **Advanced browser tool features** - Focus only on essential functionality that users depend on daily
3. **Performance optimization** - Performance improvements can be addressed in future iterations
4. **New feature additions** - No new capabilities will be added in this quick fix
5. **Bundling or build process changes** - Avoid changes that require build system modifications
6. **Complex dependency management** - Keep the solution simple and self-contained

## Technical Considerations

### Current Architecture Issues
- **Context Isolation**: Browser modules cannot use `require()` to load local dependencies
- **Module Dependencies**: Circular dependencies between browser tools create loading complexity
- **Node.js APIs**: Some modules require Node.js APIs not available in isolated renderer context

### Recommended Quick Fix Approach
- **Inline Critical Code**: Move essential functionality directly into the preload script
- **Remove Problematic Dependencies**: Eliminate module loading that causes failures
- **Preserve IPC Bridge**: Maintain existing communication patterns with main process
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure non-critical features fail silently

## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Migration Approach
The fix will be implemented using a **one-bit-at-a-time verification strategy** to ensure each piece works before proceeding:

1. **Phase 1**: Inline zoom, platform emulation, and tray functionality ✅ **STARTED**
2. **Phase 2**: Restore notifications through direct integration  
3. **Phase 3**: Add keyboard shortcuts and theme management inline
4. **Phase 4**: Test and validate all critical user workflows

### Verification Strategy
- **Test Each Module**: After inlining each browser tool, verify functionality through manual testing and console log inspection
- **Configuration Preservation**: Ensure all existing configuration options work without modification - no migration needed
- **Incremental Deployment**: Each phase can be deployed independently once verified
- **Rollback Safety**: Each change is small enough to easily revert if issues occur

### Debug Logging Requirements
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Add detailed console.log statements for each initialization step
- **Error Context**: Include specific error messages and context for troubleshooting  
- **Success Indicators**: Clear log messages when functionality initializes correctly
- **Configuration Logging**: Log relevant config values being used

### Build vs. Buy Analysis

#### Available Solutions Evaluated:

**Option 1: Webpack/Rollup Bundling**
- **Pros**: Maintains modular code, handles dependencies automatically
- **Cons**: Requires build process changes, adds complexity, higher risk
- **Evaluation**: Rejected - violates "minimal changes" requirement

**Option 2: Move Logic to Main Process**
- **Pros**: Avoids renderer context issues, maintains separation
- **Cons**: Requires extensive IPC refactoring, higher complexity
- **Evaluation**: Rejected - too much change for quick fix

**Option 3: Screen Sharing Pattern (Pure Browser + Minimal Preload)**
- **Pros**: Proven pattern, good architecture, avoids module issues
- **Cons**: Requires significant refactoring, higher risk
- **Evaluation**: Reserved for future architectural PRD

**Option 4: Inline Essential Functionality**
- **Pros**: Minimal changes, low risk, immediate fix, maintains existing patterns
- **Cons**: Less modular code, temporary solution
- **Evaluation**: **RECOMMENDED** - meets all criteria for quick fix

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
1. **Error Reduction**: Zero "module not found" errors in console logs
2. **Notification Functionality**: 100% restoration of Teams notification features
3. **User Workflow Completion**: All critical user workflows (zoom, shortcuts, tray) function normally
4. **Deployment Speed**: Fix deployed to users within 1-2 days of implementation

### Secondary Metrics
5. **Console Error Reduction**: Reduce browser console errors by 90%+
6. **User Issue Reports**: Eliminate module loading related user issue reports
7. **Developer Productivity**: Remove debugging time spent on module loading issues

## Open Questions - RESOLVED

### Implementation Decisions (Answered)

1. **Configuration Migration**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - No configuration options will be deprecated or modified. All existing configuration must continue to work without changes.

2. **Fallback Strategy**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - No specific fallback needed since functionality is already broken. Focus on comprehensive debug logging to identify and fix any remaining issues.

3. **Testing Scope**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Manual testing approach with console log verification. After each module is inlined, verify functionality works and logs appear correctly before proceeding to next module.

4. **Communication Plan**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Users have already been informed about the fix. This is a bridge solution before larger architectural improvements.

5. **Monitoring**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - No special monitoring required. Standard debug logging and existing error reporting mechanisms are sufficient.

### Configuration Verification Requirements

- **Preserve All Config Options**: Every existing configuration parameter must work exactly as before
- **Test Config-Dependent Features**: Specifically verify that configuration-driven features (zoom levels, tray settings, theme preferences) work correctly
- **Log Config Usage**: Add debug logging to show which configuration values are being applied
- **No Breaking Changes**: Zero tolerance for configuration compatibility issues

**Target Audience**: Junior developers should be able to understand and implement this fix with clear implementation guidelines and minimal architectural knowledge required.
