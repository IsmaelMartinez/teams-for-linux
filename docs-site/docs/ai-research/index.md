## Purpose

These documents capture:

- **Strategic insights** that inform development decisions
- **Comprehensive analysis** that might not fit in traditional documentation  
- **AI-generated research** that provides objective evaluation of project components
- **Context and rationale** for major feature decisions

## Target Audience

These research documents are intended for:

- **Project maintainers** making strategic decisions
- **Contributors** understanding the broader context of features
- **Future AI assistants** needing historical context
- **Documentation** of the decision-making process for major features

## Maintenance Guidelines

Research documents should be:

- **Updated** when significant changes affect the analysis
- **Referenced** in PRDs and major feature discussions
- **Used to inform** future project direction decisions
- **Preserved** as historical context even when superseded

:::note Documentation Lifecycle
While technical documentation should be kept current, research documents serve as historical records and may represent analysis from specific points in time.

## Contributing Research

When adding new research documents:

1. **Follow naming convention**: Use descriptive, hyphenated filenames
2. **Include context**: Date and scope of analysis
3. **Link related documents**: Cross-reference relevant files
4. **Update this index**: Add entries for new research documents
