# AI Collaboration Article Series

**Status:** Active | **Last updated:** December 2025

## How to Navigate This

**Quick Reference** (2 min) → Start here. 80% of the value. [Quick Reference](../01-quick-reference.md)

**Article 0** (4 min) → The philosophy. Why restraint matters more than velocity. [Philosophy](../00-philosophy.md)

**Articles 1-7** (~44 min) → Practical applications for different audiences.

**Methodology** (7 min) → The detailed workflow reference. [Methodology](../02-methodology.md)

## The Series

Seven articles about how I work with AI, and thoughts on how teams might approach it.

This isn't prescriptive methodology. It's what emerged from a year of intensive AI collaboration on an open-source project. Your mileage will vary.

### The Articles

| # | Article | What It's About | Read Time |
|---|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| 0 | [The Ultrasimplification Paradox](../00-philosophy.md) | The philosophy: why "should we?" beats "can we?" | 4 min |
| 1 | [How I Actually Use AI](01-how-i-work.md) | Personal workflow, conversational approach | 7 min |
| 2 | [The AI-Generated Code Trap](02-poc-trap.md) | Why POCs fail, prototype vs product | 6 min |
| 3 | [The Security Tax](03-security-tax.md) | Non-negotiable security requirements | 6 min |
| 4 | [Starting a Team with AI](04-team-adoption.md) | Validation-first adoption approach | 7 min |
| 5 | [Safe Starting Points](05-safe-starting.md) | Risk-tiered approach to AI usage | 6 min |
| 6 | [Learning to Code in the Age of AI](06-for-juniors.md) | Building real skills with AI | 6 min |
| 7 | [Deploying AI-Generated Code](07-deployment.md) | Feature flags, rollback, observability | 6 min |

**Total read time:** ~48 minutes

## The Core Insight

AI removed the cost of building. It didn't remove the cost of maintaining. So the discipline shifted from "can we build this?" to "should we build this?"

### The Principles

1. **Validation before generation** — Start with AI reviewing code, not writing it
2. **Risk determines involvement** — Not all code is equal; tier accordingly
3. **Confidence is earned** — Trust comes from evidence, not faith
4. **Human judgment remains essential** — AI is a tool, not a replacement
5. **Simplicity over abundance** — Fight the urge to add just because AI makes it easy

## Reading Order

**Everyone:** Start with Article 0 (the philosophy), then pick your path below.

**For individual developers:** Article 1, then 3, then whatever interests you.

**For managers/leads:** Article 2, then 4.

**For junior developers:** Article 6, then 1.

**For security-focused readers:** Article 3 stands alone.

## What This Isn't

- Not a product pitch (there's nothing to buy)
- Not a comprehensive methodology (it's personal experience)
- Not implementation guides (that's a different project)
- Not the only way to do this (your context matters)

These are thoughts that worked for me on Teams for Linux. They might work for you. They might not.
