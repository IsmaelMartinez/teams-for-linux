# Learning to Code in the Age of AI

**Read time: 6 minutes** | **Audience:** Junior developers, bootcamp graduates, career changers

*Part 6 of 7 in the [AI Collaboration series](README.md)*

## The Curriculum Was the Struggle

The first time I saw a website, I found the source code. I was ten, clicking through menus, trying things. I edited files manually — no documentation, no tutorials, no Stack Overflow — and watched what happened. By twelve, I was building my own computer. By fourteen, fixing the neighbors'.

In the 1990s, computers were rare. Only universities had the privilege. Every moment with one was precious.

The struggle wasn't a bug in my education. It was the curriculum.

When you learn without shortcuts, you build mental models. You understand cause and effect because you experience it directly. You break things, fix them, learn *why* they work — not just *that* they work.

Now AI can give you working code in seconds. A junior developer can ask "make a website" and get something functional before understanding HTML. The friction that forced understanding has been removed.

## The Uncomfortable Middle

Here's what no one tells you:

**"Don't use AI"** is unfair. The world has AI now. Avoiding it puts you at a disadvantage. Your peers use it. Your future employers expect it.

**"Use AI freely"** is dangerous. It bypasses the struggle that builds understanding. You ship code you can't debug, can't modify, can't explain.

Neither extreme works. You need a third path: **learning to learn with AI**, not learning to depend on it.

## The Artifact vs. The Skill

When you write code, you produce two things:

1. **The artifact** — the code itself, which runs and does something
2. **The skill** — the judgment, the mental model, the understanding

AI produces artifacts easily. Only you can build the skill.

Here's the test: **When the code breaks — and it will — can you debug it?**

If AI wrote it and you don't understand it, you're stuck. You'll ask AI to fix it, and it might. But you won't learn anything. The next bug will be just as mysterious.

AI amplifies whatever foundation you have:
- Strong foundation → AI makes you 10x more productive
- Weak foundation → AI makes you 10x faster at building fragile systems

**The code is not the point. The understanding is the point.** Code is evidence of skill, not a substitute for it.

## Learning With AI, Not From AI

### The "Explain It" Pattern

Don't just ask AI to write code. Ask it to teach:

**Try these learning prompts:**
- "Explain what this code does, line by line."
- "Why this approach instead of alternatives?"
- "What would break if I changed this part?"
- "What's the trade-off I'm making here?"
- "Show me the simplest possible version of this."
- "What concepts do I need to understand to modify this?"
- "If this breaks, what error would I see and why?"

Use AI as a **teaching assistant**, not a code generator. The goal is understanding, not output.

### The "Understand Before Shipping" Rule

Before you commit AI-generated code, you should be able to:

1. Explain what it does to someone else
2. Predict what happens if you change a specific line
3. Identify the error if it fails

If you can't do these, you don't understand the code. Code you don't understand will eventually hurt you.

### Intentional Struggle

There are times when you should NOT use AI:

**First implementation of a concept.** When you're learning something new — a data structure, a pattern, an algorithm — implement it yourself first. Build the mental model. Then use AI to see alternatives.

**Debugging.** This is where understanding is proven. When code breaks, resist pasting the error into AI. Read the message. Form a hypothesis. Test it. If you're stuck after genuine effort, ask AI to *explain*, not just fix.

**Occasional pen-and-paper.** My first programming exams were in C, with pen and paper. No compiler. This forced understanding the code in my head. Occasionally work through logic without a computer. It's uncomfortable. That's the point.

## Principles Are Heuristics, Not Rules

You'll learn DRY, SOLID, separation of concerns. These are valuable. But AI applies them literally, without judgment.

Take DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The principle isn't "never repeat code." It's "don't repeat *knowledge*." If two code blocks look similar but represent different concepts, duplicating them is correct. Forcing them together creates coupling where none should exist.

AI sees repeated code and refactors aggressively. Result: technically DRY code that's harder to understand and maintain.

**Learn the "why" behind principles:**
- Why does this principle exist?
- What problem does it solve?
- When does it *not* apply?

When AI suggests a refactor, don't accept blindly. Ask: "Does this make the code easier to understand, or just shorter?"

## The "AI Slop" Problem

Developers are getting tired. They call it "AI slop" — code that works but feels lifeless. No personality. Every solution looks the same because it comes from the same patterns.

Here's the thing: **Coding style is thinking style.** How you name variables, structure functions, handle errors — that reflects how you think about problems. That's your voice as a developer.

If you let AI write everything, you don't develop a voice. You become interchangeable with the tool.

**How to maintain your craft:**
- Review AI code critically. Would you have written it this way? Why or why not?
- Develop preferences. Some AI suggestions will feel wrong. Pay attention to that instinct.
- Write some code yourself, regularly. Keep your skills sharp.
- Refactor AI code in your style. Make it yours.

## Staying on the Team

AI can isolate you.

Before AI, stuck developers asked colleagues. This created conversations, relationships, shared understanding. Now you can ask AI, get an answer, and never talk to anyone.

Efficient in the short term. Damaging in the long term.

**Pair programming still matters** — maybe more than ever. When you work with another human, you learn things AI can't teach: how they think, how they debug, what they notice.

**Code reviews are learning opportunities**, not just validation gates. When someone reviews your code, they're sharing experience. When you review others', you see different approaches.

**Mentorship remains essential.** AI can answer questions, but it can't:
- Notice you're developing bad habits
- Understand your specific learning gaps
- Give career advice grounded in your context
- Model professional judgment

AI supplements mentoring. It doesn't replace it. If you have access to a mentor, use them. If you don't, seek one out.

## What to Ask Your Manager

Different teams have different comfort with AI. Before you assume, ask:

- "What's our pace for AI adoption here?"
- "Where is AI appropriate versus intentional struggle?"
- "How do I demonstrate understanding, not just output?"

If your manager only sees commits and PRs, they might not see your growth. Ask how you can show that you understand what you're building, not just that you're building it.

## The Tasks Will Change

Here's something I need to tell you: **The tasks you're learning to do may not exist in two years.**

Not "might change." May not exist.

Some of what junior developers do today — writing boilerplate, implementing standard patterns, fixing obvious bugs — AI handles adequately now and will handle better soon. The job is changing while you're learning it.

This isn't a reason to panic. It's a reason to focus on what transfers:
- **Learning to learn** — This never stops. Tools change. Concepts compound.
- **Simplifying** — KISS and YAGNI matter more than ever. Anyone can generate complexity.
- **Verifying** — Understanding if code is correct, secure, maintainable. AI generates; humans verify.
- **Communicating** — Explaining technical decisions to humans. AI can't do this for you.

The specific syntax and frameworks will change. The ability to understand, simplify, and verify — that transfers to whatever comes next.

---

## The Path Forward

Developers who will thrive:
- Build strong foundations while using AI
- Know when to use AI and when to struggle
- Maintain their craft identity and voice
- Stay connected to teams and mentors
- Understand that code is evidence of skill, not a substitute
- Focus on what transfers: learning, simplifying, verifying, communicating

**Your challenge:** Build something without AI. A small project, a feature, an algorithm. Do it the hard way. Notice what you learn.

Then build it again with AI. Compare not just the code, but what you understood at the end.

The difference is the curriculum you're giving yourself.

## For Solo Learners

Learning alone without a team? You can still apply these principles:

- **Be your own reviewer** — Before committing AI code, explain it to yourself (or a rubber duck)
- **Build projects, not just features** — Complete something. Deploy it. Maintain it.
- **Find community** — Discord servers, local meetups, open source projects. Humans matter.
- **Document your learning** — A blog, notes, anything. Teaching solidifies understanding.

Solo learning is harder. The AI makes it easier to skip the struggle. Don't let it.
