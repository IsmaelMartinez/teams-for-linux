# AI-Assisted Development

A methodology for working with AI coding assistants, evolved through practice on the Teams for Linux project.

---

## The Core Insight

AI removed the cost of building. It didn't remove the cost of maintaining. So the discipline shifted from "can we build this?" to "should we build this?"

## Start Here

### Quick Start (2 minutes)
[Quick Reference](01-quick-reference.md) — The sticky note version. Trigger words, workflow, checklist.

### The Philosophy (4 minutes)
[Ultrasimplification](00-philosophy.md) — Why restraint matters more than velocity.

### The Full Workflow (7 minutes)
[Methodology](02-methodology.md) — The 6-phase process when you need structure.

## Pick Your Path

### I'm a Developer
1. Start with [How I Actually Use AI](articles/01-how-i-work.md) — Personal workflow, conversational approach
2. Then [Security Requirements](articles/03-security-tax.md) — The non-negotiables
3. Reference [When to Skip](frameworks/when-to-skip.md) — Know when rules don't apply

### I'm Managing a Team
1. Start with [The POC Trap](articles/02-poc-trap.md) — Why prototypes fail in production
2. Then [Team Adoption](articles/04-team-adoption.md) — Validation-first approach
3. Use [Safe Starting Points](articles/05-safe-starting.md) — Risk-tiered framework

### I'm Learning to Code
1. Start with [For Junior Developers](articles/06-for-juniors.md) — Building real skills with AI
2. Then the [Philosophy](00-philosophy.md) — Understand the "why"
3. Practice with the [Quick Reference](01-quick-reference.md)

### I'm Security-Focused
1. Start with [Security Requirements](articles/03-security-tax.md) — The 7 essentials
2. Then [Safe Starting Points](articles/05-safe-starting.md) — Tier 3 restrictions
3. Reference the security checklist in [Quick Reference](01-quick-reference.md)

## What This Isn't

This isn't prescriptive methodology. It's what emerged from a year of intensive AI collaboration on an open-source project. Your context is different. Adapt accordingly.

Everything here is framed as "what worked for me" rather than "this is how to do it." The claims are experiential, not universal.
