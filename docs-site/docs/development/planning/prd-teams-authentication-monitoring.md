# PRD: Teams Authentication Monitoring

<!-- toc -->

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds comprehensive logging to monitor Microsoft Teams authentication behavior within the Teams for Linux application. The primary goal is to provide developers with visibility into when and why token refresh operations fail, enabling faster diagnosis and resolution of authentication-related issues.

Unlike the previously removed MSAL logging (which was not applicable to Teams' web authentication), this monitoring focuses on Teams' actual authentication mechanisms: native Teams APIs, network requests, and storage operations.

## Goals

1. **Debugging Enhancement**: Provide clear visibility into authentication flow failures for faster issue resolution
2. **Token Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitor token refresh cycles to identify patterns in authentication failures  
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Capture authentication events across all layers (APIs, network, storage)
4. **Zero Impact**: Implement monitoring without affecting application performance or user experience
5. **Security Compliance**: Log authentication events while filtering all sensitive data

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a developer debugging Teams for Linux authentication issues**, I want to see detailed logs of authentication events so that I can quickly identify why users are experiencing login problems or forced re-authentication cycles.

### Supporting User Stories
- **As a developer**, I want to see when Teams native authentication APIs are called so that I can understand the authentication flow
- **As a developer**, I want to monitor token refresh network requests so that I can identify network-related authentication failures
- **As a developer**, I want to track authentication token storage changes so that I can detect when tokens are being corrupted or cleared
- **As a support engineer**, I want access to authentication logs so that I can provide better assistance to users reporting login issues

## Functional Requirements

### Core Monitoring Requirements

1. **Teams Native API Monitoring**: The system must intercept and log calls to `microsoftTeams.authentication.authenticate()` and `microsoftTeams.getAuthToken()` APIs
2. **Network Request Logging**: The system must monitor HTTP requests to Microsoft authentication endpoints including:
   - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/*/oauth2/v2.0/token*`
   - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/*/oauth2/token*`
   - `https://teams.microsoft.com/api/authsvc/*`
   - `https://teams.microsoft.com/api/mt/*/beta/me*`
   - `https://*.teams.microsoft.com/*auth*`
   - `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me*`
3. **Storage Event Monitoring**: The system must track changes to localStorage and IndexedDB entries related to authentication tokens
4. **Request Lifecycle Tracking**: The system must log the complete request lifecycle (start, success/failure, error details)
5. **Sensitive Data Filtering**: The system must automatically redact token values, replacing them with `***` in all log outputs
6. **Dual Output Logging**: All authentication events must be logged to both developer console and application log files
7. **Performance Optimization**: Monitoring must not introduce noticeable performance degradation
8. **Automatic Initialization**: The system must start monitoring immediately when the application loads without requiring user configuration

### Log Format Requirements

9. **Structured Log Format**: Each log entry must include timestamp, event type, status, and sanitized details
10. **Event Categorization**: Logs must use consistent prefixes for easy filtering:
    - `🔐 [Teams Auth]` for API calls
    - `🔄 [Storage]` for storage changes  
    - `🌐 [Network]` for HTTP requests
    - `✅/❌/🚫` status indicators for success/failure/blocked
11. **Error Context**: Failed operations must include error codes and sanitized error messages

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **User Interface**: No visual indicators or user-facing authentication status displays
- **Configuration Options**: No settings or toggles for users to enable/disable monitoring  
- **Authentication Modification**: No changes to existing authentication behavior or token handling
- **Real-time Alerting**: No notifications or alerts for authentication failures
- **Token Storage**: No caching or persistent storage of authentication events
- **MSAL Integration**: No monitoring of MSAL authentication (as Teams doesn't use MSAL)
- **Performance Metrics**: No measurement of authentication timing or performance statistics

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Architecture
- **Browser Context Injection**: Authentication monitoring will be implemented in the browser context via `app/browser/` injection scripts
- **Main Process Integration**: Network request monitoring will be added to the main process session handlers
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage existing logging infrastructure (electron-log) for file output

### Integration Points
- **Preload Scripts**: Extend `app/browser/preload.js` to expose authentication monitoring APIs
- **Renderer Injection**: Add monitoring logic to `app/browser/index.js` or create new dedicated auth monitoring module
- **Session Handlers**: Integrate network monitoring into existing session configuration in `app/index.js`

### Security Considerations
- **Data Sanitization**: All token values, authorization headers, and sensitive parameters must be redacted using regex patterns
- **Log Rotation**: Authentication logs should follow existing log rotation policies to prevent disk space issues
- **Development Only**: Consider restricting detailed logging to development builds while maintaining basic monitoring in production

## Success Metrics

1. **Debugging Efficiency**: Reduce time to diagnose authentication issues by providing clear event logs
2. **Issue Resolution**: Enable faster identification of token refresh failures and authentication bottlenecks
3. **Zero Performance Impact**: Monitoring overhead should be unmeasurable in normal application usage
4. **Complete Coverage**: Capture 100% of authentication events across all monitoring layers
5. **Security Compliance**: Zero incidents of sensitive data exposure in logs

## Implementation Notes

### Existing Solutions Research

**Teams Native Authentication**: Microsoft Teams web applications use proprietary authentication mechanisms rather than standard MSAL libraries. The monitoring must focus on:
- Teams SDK authentication methods
- Microsoft Graph API calls
- Azure AD token refresh endpoints

**Browser API Monitoring**: Standard approaches include:
- Function interception/wrapping
- Storage event listeners  
- Network request monitoring via webRequest API

**Electron Logging**: Leverage existing electron-log infrastructure for consistent log formatting and file management.

### Build vs. Buy Analysis
**Build Internally**: Authentication monitoring is highly specific to Teams for Linux's architecture and existing logging infrastructure. No suitable third-party solutions exist for this specific use case.

## Open Questions

1. **Log Level Configuration**: Should authentication logs be tied to existing log level settings, or always enabled?
2. **Storage Event Filtering**: What specific localStorage/IndexedDB key patterns indicate authentication-related data?
3. **Network Timeout Handling**: How should we handle authentication requests that timeout or hang?
4. **Error Categorization**: Should we distinguish between network errors, server errors, and client-side authentication failures?

> [!NOTE]
> This PRD focuses on observable authentication behavior rather than modifying Teams' authentication mechanisms. The implementation should be purely diagnostic and non-intrusive.
