# Product Requirements Document: GitHub Pages Documentation Deployment

<!-- toc -->

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation of GitHub Pages deployment for the Teams for Linux documentation to make project documentation more accessible to end users without requiring them to clone the repository or navigate GitHub's file interface.

### Problem Statement
Currently, Teams for Linux documentation resides in the `/docs` folder and is only accessible through GitHub's file browser interface. This creates barriers for end users who need installation guides, configuration help, and troubleshooting information but are not familiar with GitHub's interface.

### Goal
Deploy the existing `/docs` folder as a GitHub Pages website to provide end users with easy access to documentation through a standard web interface.

## Goals

1. **Improve Documentation Accessibility**: Make documentation available via a standard website URL
2. **Increase Documentation Usage**: Provide a user-friendly interface that encourages documentation consumption
3. **Reduce Support Burden**: Enable users to self-serve through easily accessible documentation
4. **Maintain Simplicity**: Implement with minimal configuration and maintenance overhead

## User Stories

1. **As an end user**, I want to access Teams for Linux documentation through a standard website so that I can easily find installation and configuration information without navigating GitHub.

2. **As a new user**, I want to quickly find troubleshooting guides and configuration options so that I can resolve issues independently.

3. **As a system administrator**, I want to reference documentation URLs in deployment scripts and internal wikis so that my team can access current information.

4. **As a project maintainer**, I want documentation updates to be automatically published so that users always see the latest information without additional deployment steps.

## Functional Requirements

1. **GitHub Pages Configuration**: The system must enable GitHub Pages deployment from the `/docs` folder using GitHub's built-in functionality.

2. **Automatic Deployment**: The system must automatically deploy documentation updates whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

3. **Current Structure Preservation**: The system must maintain the existing documentation structure and file organization without requiring reorganization.

4. **Default Styling**: The system must use GitHub's default Jekyll theme for consistent, professional appearance with minimal configuration.

5. **Standard URL Access**: The system must make documentation available at the standard GitHub Pages URL format: `https://IsmaelMartinez.github.io/teams-for-linux`.

6. **Markdown Rendering**: The system must properly render all existing markdown content including headers, lists, code blocks, and links.

7. **Navigation Support**: The system must provide basic navigation through Jekyll's default theme capabilities.

8. **Mobile Compatibility**: The system must render documentation appropriately on mobile devices through the default theme's responsive design.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Custom Theming**: No custom CSS, branding, or visual modifications beyond the default Jekyll theme
2. **Search Functionality**: No built-in search capabilities (users can use browser search)
3. **Custom Domain**: No custom domain configuration - standard GitHub Pages URL only
4. **Mermaid Diagram Rendering**: No special configuration for Mermaid diagrams (acceptable if they don't render)
5. **Content Reorganization**: No restructuring of existing documentation hierarchy
6. **Advanced Jekyll Features**: No custom plugins, layouts, or Jekyll-specific enhancements
7. **Analytics Integration**: No visitor tracking or usage analytics
8. **Multi-language Support**: No internationalization features

## Design Considerations

### Content Structure
- Maintain current `/docs/README.md` as the homepage
- Preserve existing file hierarchy and navigation patterns
- Ensure relative links between documentation files continue to work

### User Experience
- Rely on Jekyll's default theme for consistent GitHub ecosystem appearance
- Ensure documentation remains scannable and easy to navigate
- Maintain fast page load times through minimal configuration

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Approach
- Use GitHub Pages' built-in `/docs` folder deployment option (no custom workflows required)
- Leverage Jekyll's automatic markdown processing
- No additional configuration files needed initially

### Dependencies
- GitHub Pages service (no additional dependencies)
- Jekyll (automatically provided by GitHub Pages)
- Default Jekyll theme (automatically applied)

### Constraints
- Limited to GitHub Pages' built-in Jekyll functionality
- No custom plugins due to GitHub Pages security restrictions
- Mermaid diagrams may not render (acceptable limitation)

### Maintenance
- Zero maintenance overhead - automatic deployment from main branch
- Documentation updates follow existing workflow (edit files in `/docs`)
- No separate build or deployment processes required

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
1. **Documentation Page Views**: Increase in documentation access through web interface vs. GitHub file views
2. **User Engagement**: Time spent on documentation pages and bounce rate improvement
3. **Accessibility**: Successful deployment and consistent availability of documentation site

### Secondary Metrics
1. **Support Request Reduction**: Decrease in basic configuration and setup questions
2. **Community Growth**: Increased user self-sufficiency leading to better community engagement
3. **Professional Appearance**: Positive feedback on documentation accessibility and presentation

## Open Questions

1. **Analytics**: Should we consider adding basic analytics in a future iteration to measure success metrics?
2. **Content Gaps**: Are there any documentation gaps that should be addressed before or after deployment?
3. **Feedback Mechanism**: Should we add a simple feedback mechanism for documentation quality?
4. **SEO Optimization**: Should we consider basic SEO improvements like meta descriptions in a future iteration?

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Basic Deployment
- Enable GitHub Pages from repository settings
- Configure source as `/docs` folder from main branch
- Verify all existing documentation renders correctly
- Test navigation and link functionality

### Phase 2: Validation
- Verify automatic deployment on documentation updates
- Test mobile responsiveness
- Validate all existing content accessibility
- Confirm URL structure and navigation work as expected

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled and serving from `/docs` folder
- [ ] All existing markdown files render correctly
- [ ] Internal links between documentation files work
- [ ] Site is accessible at standard GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] Automatic deployment occurs on main branch updates
- [ ] Mobile devices can access and navigate documentation
- [ ] No broken links or rendering issues in existing content
