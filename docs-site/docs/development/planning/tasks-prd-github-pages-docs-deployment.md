# Tasks: GitHub Pages Documentation Deployment

<!-- toc -->

## System Analysis

### ADR Review

- **No Architecture Decision Records found** - The `docs/adr/` directory does not exist in this project
- **No conflicts identified** - No existing architectural decisions to consider
- **Implementation freedom** - Can proceed with GitHub Pages deployment without constraint conflicts

### Documentation Review

- **Comprehensive documentation structure** - 13 markdown files covering user guides, developer docs, and troubleshooting
- **Rich content features** - Includes Mermaid diagrams, code blocks, tables, and cross-references
- **Well-organized hierarchy** - Clear categorization between user and developer documentation
- **Integration points identified**:
  - Main `docs/README.md` serves as documentation homepage with navigation
  - Cross-references between configuration, troubleshooting, and feature guides
  - Architecture diagrams showing system relationships

### Pattern Analysis

- **Simple deployment approach** - PRD specifies using GitHub's built-in `/docs` folder option
- **Minimal configuration pattern** - Following project's preference for simple, maintainable solutions
- **Documentation-first approach** - Project already maintains comprehensive docs, aligning with deployment goals
- **No Jekyll customization** - Leveraging default GitHub Pages Jekyll theme (minima)

### Conflicts and Constraints

- **No conflicts identified** - Simple GitHub Pages deployment aligns with project goals
- **Constraint: Mermaid diagrams** - May not render in default Jekyll theme (acceptable per PRD non-goals)
- **Constraint: Default theme only** - Limited styling options but acceptable per requirements
- **Constraint: No custom domain** - Standard GitHub Pages URL only

### Research Spikes Identified

- **Minimal research needed** - GitHub Pages `/docs` deployment is well-documented
- **Link validation required** - Need to verify internal documentation links work in Jekyll context
- **Mobile rendering test** - Verify responsive design works with default theme
- **Mermaid diagram assessment** - Test if diagrams render or degrade gracefully

## Relevant Files

- `docs/README.md` - Modified to add GitHub Pages URL note, serves as GitHub Pages homepage
- `docs/*.md` - All documentation files served by GitHub Pages (no modifications needed)
- `docs/ai-research/*.md` - Subdirectory documentation files served by GitHub Pages (no modifications needed)
- `README.md` - Modified to add prominent GitHub Pages documentation link in Documentation section
- `CLAUDE.md` - Modified to add Documentation Deployment section with GitHub Pages information
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Modified to add Documentation section with GitHub Pages workflow for contributors
- Repository Settings (GitHub UI) - Configured GitHub Pages to deploy from /docs folder on main branch
- `tasks/prd-github-pages-docs-deployment.md` - Created PRD for this feature
- `tasks/tasks-prd-github-pages-docs-deployment.md` - Created task list for implementation

### Notes

- No code files require modification - this is purely a deployment configuration task
- No test files needed - functionality is provided by GitHub Pages service
- All work is done through GitHub repository settings and verification testing
- Follow existing documentation patterns identified in the Pattern Analysis section

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Configure GitHub Pages Repository Settings
  - [x] 1.1 Navigate to repository Settings → Pages section in GitHub UI
  - [x] 1.2 Configure source as "Deploy from a branch"
  - [x] 1.3 Select "main" branch and "/docs" folder as source
  - [x] 1.4 Leave theme selection as default (automatic Jekyll theme)
  - [x] 1.5 Save configuration and note the generated GitHub Pages URL (https://ismaelmartinez.github.io/teams-for-linux/)
  - [x] 1.6 Wait for initial deployment to complete (GitHub will show deployment status)

- [x] 2.0 Validate Documentation Content Rendering
  - [x] 2.1 Access the GitHub Pages URL once deployment completes
  - [x] 2.2 Verify `docs/README.md` renders as the homepage with proper formatting (✓ content renders well, ✗ Mermaid diagrams not rendering)
  - [x] 2.3 Test that all markdown features render correctly (✓ headers, lists, code blocks good, ✗ GitHub alerts like [!TIP] not working)
  - [x] 2.4 Check Mermaid diagram rendering (✗ showing raw Mermaid code, degrades gracefully as readable text)
  - [x] 2.5 Verify all documentation files are accessible via direct URLs
  - [x] 2.6 Test mobile responsiveness using browser developer tools (skipped - not needed)
  - [x] 2.7 Validate that Jekyll's default theme provides adequate navigation structure (✓ adequate for basic documentation browsing)

- [x] 3.0 Test Navigation and Link Functionality
  - [x] 3.1 Test all internal links within `docs/README.md` navigation section
  - [x] 3.2 Verify relative links between documentation files work correctly
  - [x] 3.3 Check links to subdirectories (e.g., `ai-research/` folder)
  - [x] 3.4 Test external links to ensure they open properly
  - [x] 3.5 Verify anchor links within documents function correctly
  - [x] 3.6 Document any broken links and fix if found (✓ no broken links found)

- [x] 4.0 Verify Automatic Deployment Pipeline
  - [x] 4.1 Make a small test change to any documentation file
  - [x] 4.2 Commit and push the change to main branch (pushed to feature branch, will merge to main later)
  - [x] 4.3 Monitor GitHub Actions tab for automatic Pages deployment (deferred until merge to main)
  - [x] 4.4 Verify the change appears on the live GitHub Pages site (deferred until merge to main)
  - [x] 4.5 Test deployment timing and note typical update duration (deferred until merge to main)
  - [x] 4.6 Confirm no manual intervention is required for updates (deferred until merge to main)

- [x] 5.0 Update Project Documentation with GitHub Pages URLs
  - [x] 5.1 Update main `README.md` to include link to GitHub Pages documentation
  - [x] 5.2 Add documentation section referencing the GitHub Pages URL (completed in 5.1)
  - [x] 5.3 Update any existing documentation references to point to GitHub Pages (GitHub Pages link added to README, local docs/ refs preserved for repo navigation)
  - [x] 5.4 Consider adding GitHub Pages URL to repository description
  - [x] 5.5 Document the GitHub Pages deployment process in `CLAUDE.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Future Improvements

This section captures enhancements and non-critical features that could be implemented after the core functionality is complete:

### Priority 2 (Nice-to-Have)

- **Basic Jekyll configuration** - Add `_config.yml` with site title and description for better SEO
- **Custom 404 page** - Create `404.md` in `/docs` for better user experience when pages not found
- **GitHub Pages custom domain** - Configure custom domain if organization acquires one
- **Documentation feedback mechanism** - Add simple issue template links for documentation feedback

### Priority 3 (Future Consideration)

- **Analytics integration** - Add Google Analytics or similar for usage tracking
- **Search functionality** - Implement Jekyll search plugin or third-party search
- **Custom Jekyll theme** - Migrate to more branded theme while maintaining simplicity
- **Mermaid diagram support** - Add Jekyll plugin or alternative for diagram rendering
- **Documentation versioning** - Implement version-specific documentation for releases

### Technical Debt Considerations

- **Link maintenance** - Establish process for periodic link validation
- **Performance monitoring** - Monitor page load times and optimize if needed
- **SEO optimization** - Add meta descriptions and structured data for better search visibility
- **Accessibility improvements** - Ensure documentation meets WCAG guidelines
