# Tasks: Teams Authentication Monitoring

## System Analysis

### ADR Review

- No formal Architecture Decision Records found in `docs/adr/` directory
- No architectural constraints identified from existing ADRs
- Implementation should follow established patterns in the existing codebase

### Documentation Review

- **Logging Infrastructure**: `app/config/logger.js` provides electron-log integration with configurable transports
- **Browser Context**: `app/browser/` contains injection scripts with established patterns for preload/renderer communication
- **IPC Communication**: Extensive IPC usage patterns found in `app/browser/preload.js` with contextBridge APIs
- **Session Management**: Session handling exists in `app/index.js` with partition-specific configurations

### Pattern Analysis

- **Modular Architecture**: Browser functionality is organized into distinct modules under `app/browser/tools/`
- **IPC Pattern**: Use `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld()` in preload scripts and `ipcRenderer.invoke()/send()` for communication
- **Logging Pattern**: Use electron-log with console fallback, structured logging with prefixes
- **Initialization Pattern**: Config-driven initialization with async module loading in `app/browser/index.js`
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with debug logging for graceful degradation

### Conflicts and Constraints

- **Performance Constraint**: Monitoring must not impact Teams web app performance
- **Security Constraint**: All sensitive data must be filtered before logging
- **Architecture Constraint**: Must integrate with existing logging infrastructure without breaking changes
- **Browser Context Constraint**: Limited access to DOM/window objects from preload scripts

### Research Spikes Identified

- **Teams API Detection**: Investigation needed to identify when Teams SDK becomes available in browser context
- **Storage Key Patterns**: Research required to identify localStorage/IndexedDB keys used by Teams for authentication
- **Network Request Patterns**: Analysis needed to determine which authentication endpoints Teams actually uses
- **Sensitive Data Patterns**: Investigation required to create comprehensive regex patterns for data sanitization

## Relevant Files

- `app/browser/tools/authMonitor.js` - New module for Teams authentication monitoring functionality
- `app/browser/preload.js` - Extend existing preload script to expose auth monitoring APIs
- `app/browser/index.js` - Integrate auth monitoring initialization with existing module loading
- `app/index.js` - Add network request monitoring to existing session configuration
- `app/config/logger.js` - Potentially extend for auth-specific logging configuration

### Notes

- Follow existing browser tools pattern for modular organization
- Use established IPC communication patterns from screen sharing and notification modules  
- Leverage existing electron-log infrastructure for consistent log formatting
- Ensure integration with existing session and partition management

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Research and Design Authentication Detection Mechanisms
  - [ ] 1.1 **Research Spike**: Analyze Teams web app in browser console to identify when `microsoftTeams` SDK becomes available
  - [ ] 1.2 **Research Spike**: Document actual authentication API calls made by Teams (`microsoftTeams.authentication.authenticate`, `getAuthToken`)
  - [ ] 1.3 **Research Spike**: Identify localStorage and IndexedDB key patterns used by Teams for authentication storage
  - [ ] 1.4 **Research Spike**: Monitor network requests in Teams to identify actual authentication endpoints used
  - [ ] 1.5 **Research Spike**: Test authentication flow variations (login, token refresh, logout) to understand event sequences
  - [ ] 1.6 Document findings and create authentication monitoring specification with detected patterns and endpoints
  - [ ] 1.7 Create comprehensive regex patterns for sensitive data sanitization based on discovered token formats

- [ ] 2.0 Implement Core Authentication Monitoring Module
  - [ ] 2.1 Create `app/browser/tools/authMonitor.js` following existing browser tools module pattern
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement Teams SDK detection with polling mechanism to wait for `window.microsoftTeams` availability
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement Teams API interception for `microsoftTeams.authentication.authenticate()` with success/failure logging
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement Teams API interception for `microsoftTeams.getAuthToken()` with success/failure logging
  - [ ] 2.5 Create structured logging functions with consistent prefixes (`üîê [Teams Auth]`, `‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `üö´`)
  - [ ] 2.6 Implement error categorization (network errors, server errors, client errors) with appropriate logging
  - [ ] 2.7 Add module initialization and cleanup functions following established patterns

- [ ] 3.0 Integrate Network Request Monitoring
  - [ ] 3.1 Add authentication endpoint filters to main process session configuration in `app/index.js`
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement `webRequest.onBeforeRequest` handler for authentication endpoints with sanitized logging
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement `webRequest.onCompleted` handler to log response status codes and timing information
  - [ ] 3.4 Implement `webRequest.onErrorOccurred` handler for network-level authentication failures
  - [ ] 3.5 Add request lifecycle correlation to match requests with responses using request IDs
  - [ ] 3.6 Integrate with existing session partition management to ensure proper isolation

- [ ] 4.0 Add Storage Event Monitoring  
  - [ ] 4.1 Implement localStorage monitoring by intercepting `Storage.prototype.setItem` and `removeItem`
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement storage event listener for cross-tab authentication token changes
  - [ ] 4.3 Add authentication-related key filtering based on research spike findings (keys containing 'token', 'auth', 'session')
  - [ ] 4.4 Implement sanitized logging for storage changes with `üîÑ [Storage]` prefix
  - [ ] 4.5 Add IndexedDB change detection for authentication data (if patterns identified in research)

- [ ] 5.0 Implement Logging and Data Sanitization
  - [ ] 5.1 Create comprehensive data sanitization function using regex patterns from research spike
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement dual output logging to both console (for development) and electron-log files
  - [ ] 5.3 Add structured log formatting with timestamps, event types, and status indicators
  - [ ] 5.4 Integrate with existing `app/config/logger.js` configuration for consistent log levels
  - [ ] 5.5 Add performance optimization to prevent excessive logging during high-frequency events
  - [ ] 5.6 Implement log context correlation to group related authentication events
  - [ ] 5.7 Add module integration with `app/browser/index.js` initialization sequence
  - [ ] 5.8 Extend `app/browser/preload.js` to expose authentication monitoring status (if needed for debugging)
  - [ ] 5.9 Add graceful error handling for monitoring failures without affecting Teams functionality
  - [ ] 5.10 **Testing**: Verify monitoring works across authentication scenarios (fresh login, token refresh, logout, errors)

## Future Improvements

This section captures enhancements and non-critical features that could be implemented after the core functionality is complete:

### Priority 2 (Nice-to-Have)

- Authentication event metrics and statistics collection
- Configurable log levels for authentication monitoring
- Authentication health status dashboard in debug menu
- Export authentication logs to external monitoring tools

### Priority 3 (Future Consideration)

- Integration with application performance monitoring (APM) tools
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection for authentication patterns
- Real-time authentication status indicators for developers
- Automated authentication issue reporting and diagnostics

### Technical Debt Considerations

- Evaluate impact on bundle size from new monitoring code
- Consider performance optimizations for high-frequency logging
- Review data sanitization patterns for completeness and efficiency
- Assess long-term maintainability of authentication endpoint detection
