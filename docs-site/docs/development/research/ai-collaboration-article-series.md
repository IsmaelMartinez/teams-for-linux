## The Series

Six articles about how I work with AI, and thoughts on how teams might approach it.

This isn't prescriptive methodology. It's what emerged from a year of intensive AI collaboration on an open-source project. Your mileage will vary.

### The Articles

| # | Article | What It's About | Read Time |

## The Core Ideas

If you take nothing else:

1. **Validation before generation** — Start with AI reviewing code, not writing it
2. **Risk determines involvement** — Not all code is equal; tier accordingly
3. **Confidence is earned** — Trust comes from evidence, not faith
4. **Human judgment remains essential** — AI is a tool, not a replacement
5. **Simplicity over abundance** — Fight the urge to add just because AI makes it easy

## Reading Order

**For individual developers:** Start with Article 1, then 3, then whatever interests you.

**For managers/leads:** Start with Article 2, then 4.

**For junior developers:** Start with Article 6, then 1.

**For security-focused readers:** Article 3 stands alone.

## What This Isn't

- Not a product pitch (there's nothing to buy)
- Not a comprehensive methodology (it's personal experience)
- Not implementation guides (that's a different project)
- Not the only way to do this (your context matters)

These are thoughts that worked for me on Teams for Linux. They might work for you. They might not.
