# GitHub Issue Bot Research & Implementation Plan

**Status:** Active Research
**Date:** February 2026
**Issue:** Investigation for intelligent GitHub issue automation
**Author:** Claude AI Assistant
**Dependencies:** None (builds on existing infrastructure)

---

## Executive Summary

This document investigates implementing an intelligent GitHub issue bot for Teams for Linux that could:

1. **Suggest solutions** for common issues using existing documentation
2. **Detect potential duplicate issues** from historical data
3. **Trigger research jobs** for enhancement requests
4. **Request clarification** and logs from reporters
5. **Reduce maintainer workload** by automating initial triage

### Key Principle

The bot should use **humble, suggestive language** ("might", "could", "this appears to be similar to") rather than definitive statements. It assists maintainers rather than replacing human judgment.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Duplicate Issues**: Users report issues that have been solved before or are known limitations
2. **Missing Information**: Bug reports often lack logs, version info, or reproduction steps
3. **Enhancement Noise**: Feature requests without context or prior research
4. **Maintainer Time**: Manual triage consumes significant maintainer bandwidth
5. **Knowledge Gap**: Users don't know about existing solutions in documentation

### Opportunity

The repository has **rich structured data** that could inform an intelligent bot:

- **Troubleshooting guide** (`docs-site/docs/troubleshooting.md`) - Common issues and solutions
- **16 research documents** with detailed feature investigations
- **13 ADRs** documenting technical decisions and rejected approaches
- **Issue templates** with structured fields (version, package type, reproduction steps)
- **Historical closed issues** (patterns of what worked)
- **Roadmap** showing planned/blocked/rejected features

---

## 2. Proposed Bot Capabilities

### 2.1 Solution Suggester (Bug Reports)

**Trigger:** New issue with `bug` label or using bug report template

**Behavior:**
1. Analyze issue title and description
2. Search troubleshooting guide and closed issues for matches
3. If match found, comment with suggestive language:

```markdown
👋 Thanks for reporting this issue!

This might be related to a known issue. Here are some things that could help:

**Possible matches from our troubleshooting guide:**
- [Blank Page at Login](../../troubleshooting.md#issue-blank-page-at-login) - If you're seeing "Microsoft Teams - initializing"
- [Application Cache Issues](../../troubleshooting.md#issue-application-fails-to-launch-after-update) - If this started after an update

**Could you try these steps?**
1. Clear the application cache: `rm -rf ~/.config/teams-for-linux/Cache`
2. Restart the application

If this doesn't help, please share:
- Your debug log (`~/.config/teams-for-linux/logs/main.log`)
- Your package type (AppImage, deb, rpm, snap, flatpak)

*I'm a bot providing suggestions based on documentation. A maintainer will review this issue.*
```

**Language Guidelines:**
- "This **might** be related to..."
- "You **could** try..."
- "This **appears** similar to..."
- "If I'm understanding correctly..."
- Never: "This **is** a duplicate" or "You **should** do..."

### 2.2 Duplicate Detector

**Trigger:** New issue opened

**Behavior:**
1. Generate embeddings from issue title + body
2. Compare against embeddings of open issues and recent closed issues
3. If similarity score > threshold, suggest possible duplicates:

```markdown
🔍 This issue might be related to existing discussions:

**Potentially related open issues:**
- #1987 - "Tray icon doesn't show logout state" (75% similar)
- #2015 - "Camera stays on after screen lock" (68% similar)

**Recently resolved issues that could be relevant:**
- #1755 - "Window decorations stuck in dark mode" (Resolved in v2.2.1)

If one of these matches your issue, consider adding your details there instead.

*Similarity is based on content analysis and may not be exact.*
```

### 2.3 Enhancement Research Trigger

**Trigger:** New issue with `enhancement` label or feature request template

**Behavior:**
1. Check if feature exists in:
   - Roadmap (planned, blocked, rejected)
   - Research documents (investigated)
   - ADRs (decided against)
2. Provide context and potentially trigger research workflow:

```markdown
📋 Thanks for the feature suggestion!

**Current status of related features:**

This appears related to our research on [Graph API Integration](graph-api-integration-research.md):
- **Phase 1** (POC): ✅ Complete
- **Phases 2-3**: Awaiting user feedback

Your feedback helps prioritize development! A maintainer will review this request.

**If this is a new feature area**, we might create a research spike to investigate feasibility.

*Based on our [Development Roadmap](../plan/roadmap.md) and [Research Documents](README.md).*
```

For truly new features, the bot could:
- Add a `needs-research` label
- Optionally trigger a GitHub Action to create a research document skeleton

### 2.4 Information Request Bot

**Trigger:** Bug report missing required information

**Behavior:**
1. Parse issue against template requirements
2. Identify missing critical fields
3. Request specific information:

```markdown
ℹ️ To help investigate this issue, could you provide some additional details?

**Missing information:**
- [ ] Teams for Linux version (`--version` flag)
- [ ] Package type (AppImage, deb, rpm, snap, flatpak)
- [ ] Desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, etc.)
- [ ] Debug log (`~/.config/teams-for-linux/logs/main.log`)

**How to get debug logs:**
1. Start the app with `teams-for-linux --enable-logging`
2. Reproduce the issue
3. Share the log file (feel free to redact sensitive info)

*This information helps us reproduce and fix the issue faster.*
```

### 2.5 Stale Issue Nudge (Enhancement to Existing)

The repo already has `stale.yml`. The bot could enhance this with:
- Summarize any progress made on the issue
- Link to relevant documentation created since the issue was opened
- Suggest closing if the feature was implemented elsewhere

---

## 3. Technical Implementation Options

### 3.1 Option A: GitHub Actions + External AI API

**Architecture:**
```
Issue Event → GitHub Action → AI API (Gemini/Claude) → Comment on Issue
```

**Pros:**
- Builds on existing `changelog-generator.yml` pattern
- Uses proven Gemini integration (free tier: 1,500 req/day)
- No infrastructure to maintain

**Cons:**
- Limited context window for large documentation searches
- May require pre-processing documentation into embeddings

**Estimated Cost:** Free (within Gemini free tier)

### 3.2 Option B: GitHub Actions + RAG System

**Architecture:**
```
Issue Event → GitHub Action → RAG Query → Vector DB → AI API → Comment
```

**Components:**
1. **Embedding generation**: Pre-process docs into embeddings
2. **Vector storage**: Pinecone free tier, Supabase, or GitHub-hosted JSON
3. **RAG query**: Retrieve relevant chunks for AI context

**Pros:**
- Better accuracy for document matching
- Scales to large documentation bases
- More precise duplicate detection

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Requires embedding regeneration when docs change
- Additional service dependency

**Estimated Cost:** Free with Pinecone starter tier + Gemini

### 3.3 Option C: Dedicated GitHub App/Bot

**Architecture:**
```
GitHub Webhooks → Cloud Function/Worker → AI + DB → GitHub API
```

**Pros:**
- Real-time response (not limited by Action queue)
- More sophisticated state management
- Could handle comment replies, not just new issues

**Cons:**
- Infrastructure to maintain
- More complex deployment
- Requires hosting (Cloudflare Workers free tier possible)

**Estimated Cost:** Free tier possible, ~$5-10/month if scaled

### 3.4 Recommendation

**Start with Option A (GitHub Actions + Gemini)** as an MVP:
- Proven pattern from changelog generator
- Zero infrastructure cost
- Can evolve to Option B if accuracy needs improvement

## 4. Data Sources & Integration

### 4.1 Documentation Corpus

| Source | Content | Size | Update Frequency |
|--------|---------|------|------------------|
| `troubleshooting.md` | Common issues & solutions | ~300 lines | Monthly |
| `configuration.md` | All config options | ~500 lines | Per release |
| Research docs (16) | Feature investigations | ~200 lines each | As needed |
| ADRs (13) | Technical decisions | ~100 lines each | Per decision |
| Module READMEs | Implementation details | ~50 lines each | Per change |

### 4.2 Issue Patterns

For duplicate detection, analyze:
- Issue titles (high signal)
- Issue body first paragraph (problem statement)
- Labels applied
- Linked PRs and commits

### 4.3 Embedding Strategy

Pre-compute embeddings for:
1. Each troubleshooting section (by `####` headers)
2. Each research document executive summary
3. Each ADR decision summary
4. Each closed issue (title + first comment if resolution)

Store in `.github/issue-bot/embeddings.json` or external vector DB.

---

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Information Request Bot (MVP)

**Scope:** Detect missing information in bug reports, request details

**Files:**
```
.github/workflows/issue-triage-bot.yml
.github/issue-bot/templates/missing-info.md
```

**Effort:** 1-2 days

**Value:** Reduces back-and-forth, gets issues to actionable state faster

### Phase 2: Solution Suggester

**Scope:** Match issues against troubleshooting guide

**Additional Files:**
```
.github/issue-bot/troubleshooting-index.json  # Pre-processed
.github/issue-bot/templates/suggestion.md
```

**Effort:** 3-5 days

**Value:** Resolves common issues without maintainer intervention

### Phase 3: Duplicate Detector

**Scope:** Compare new issues against open/recent closed issues

**Additional Files:**
```
.github/issue-bot/issue-embeddings.json  # Generated weekly
.github/workflows/update-embeddings.yml   # Weekly cron job
.github/issue-bot/templates/duplicate.md
```

**Effort:** 1 week

**Value:** Consolidates discussion, reduces duplicate investigation

### Phase 4: Enhancement Context

**Scope:** Link feature requests to roadmap/research/ADRs

**Additional Files:**
```
.github/issue-bot/feature-index.json  # Roadmap + research mapping
.github/issue-bot/templates/enhancement.md
```

**Effort:** 3-5 days

**Value:** Saves maintainer time explaining "already investigated" or "planned"

### Phase 5: Research Trigger (Optional)

**Scope:** Auto-create research document skeleton for new feature areas

**Effort:** 2-3 days

**Value:** Systematizes enhancement investigation

## 6. Bot Language & Tone Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Humility**: The bot suggests, never dictates
2. **Transparency**: Always disclose bot status
3. **Helpfulness**: Focus on solving user's problem
4. **Respect**: Thank users for contributing

### Required Phrases

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "This is a duplicate of #123" | "This might be related to #123" |
| "You need to provide logs" | "Could you share your logs? This would help us investigate" |
| "This feature was rejected" | "We investigated this previously - here's what we found" |
| "Fixed in v2.3.0" | "This appears to have been addressed in v2.3.0 - could you confirm?" |

### Template Structure

```markdown
[Greeting emoji] [Thank user]

[Main suggestion with humble language]

**[Section header]:**
- [Specific suggestions with links]

[Request for user action or feedback]

*[Bot disclosure and limitations notice]*
```

---

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1 Prompt Injection Protection

User-submitted issue content goes to AI. Mitigations:
- Sanitize input (remove markdown code blocks from prompt)
- Use system prompts that instruct AI to ignore embedded instructions
- Validate AI output before posting (check for unexpected content)

### 7.2 Rate Limiting

- Limit to one bot comment per issue
- Cooldown period before re-analyzing edited issues
- Don't respond to issues from known bot accounts

### 7.3 Sensitive Data

- Never include user emails or identifiers in prompts
- Don't expose internal file paths or server details
- Sanitize log snippets users might paste

### 7.4 Permissions

Use minimal GitHub token permissions:
- `issues: write` (to comment)
- `contents: read` (to read docs)

---

## 8. Success Metrics

### Quantitative

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Issues resolved by bot suggestions | 20% of bugs | Track issues closed within 48h after bot comment |
| Duplicate consolidation | 30% reduction | Compare open issue count month-over-month |
| Time to first response | < 5 minutes | Timestamp of bot comment vs issue creation |
| Missing info completion rate | 60% | Issues edited to add requested info |

### Qualitative

- User sentiment in issue comments (positive/negative reactions to bot)
- Maintainer feedback on triage time saved
- Accuracy of duplicate suggestions (false positive rate)

---

## 9. Comparison with Existing Solutions

### GitHub Actions + Probot Alternatives

| Solution | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Probot** | Full-featured, mature | Requires hosting |
| **GitHub Actions** | No hosting, native | Limited webhook types |
| **GitHub Copilot for Issues** | Official, integrated | Not customizable |

### AI-Powered Issue Bots

| Solution | Model | Cost | Customization |
|----------|-------|------|---------------|
| **Sweep AI** | GPT-4 | $20+/mo | Low |
| **Sourcery** | Various | $12+/mo | Medium |
| **Custom (this proposal)** | Gemini Flash | Free | High |

**Recommendation:** Custom solution provides best value given:
- Existing Gemini integration and experience
- Specific documentation corpus
- Need for humble, project-specific language

---

## 10. Open Questions

### Technical

1. **Embedding model choice**: Gemini embeddings vs. open source (sentence-transformers)?
2. **Similarity threshold**: What score indicates "likely duplicate"?
3. **Update frequency**: How often to regenerate documentation index?

### Process

1. **Maintainer override**: How to handle bot mistakes? (thumbs down reaction? label?)
2. **Bot silence**: Should some issues skip bot entirely? (e.g., security reports)
3. **Multi-language**: Support non-English issues?

### Scope

1. **PR integration**: Should bot also analyze PRs? (changelog bot already does)
2. **Discussion support**: Extend to GitHub Discussions?
3. **External feedback**: Integration with Matrix chat mentioned in templates?

---

## 11. Alternative Approaches

### 11.1 Enhanced Issue Templates Only

Instead of a bot, improve templates to:
- Add dropdown for "I've checked troubleshooting guide"
- Link to search of existing issues
- Require version/package fields

**Pros:** No AI dependency, simple
**Cons:** Relies on user compliance, no active assistance

### 11.2 Documentation-First Approach

Focus investment on:
- Better SEO for troubleshooting docs
- More comprehensive FAQ
- Video tutorials for common issues

**Pros:** Prevents issues before they're filed
**Cons:** Users may not find docs before filing

### 11.3 Human Triage Team

Recruit community members for initial triage:
- Provide triage guidelines
- Use saved replies for common responses
- Reward active triagers

**Pros:** Human judgment, community building
**Cons:** Requires ongoing volunteer commitment

---

## 12. Smaller Quick Wins (Immediate Improvements)

While researching the full bot, these could be implemented immediately:

### 12.1 Enhanced Stale Bot Messages

Update `stale.yml` to include:
- Link to troubleshooting guide
- Mention of relevant version if issue predates a release
- Softer language

### 12.2 Issue Template Enhancements

Add to bug report template:
- Checkbox: "I have checked the troubleshooting guide"
- Dropdown: "Package type" (required)
- Link: "Search existing issues" URL

### 12.3 Saved Replies

Create GitHub Saved Replies for maintainer use:
- "Please provide logs"
- "This appears fixed in vX.X.X"
- "This is a known Teams web limitation"
- "Please try clearing cache"

### 12.4 Label Automation

Use `actions/labeler` to auto-apply labels based on:
- Keywords in title (audio, video, notification, etc.)
- Package type mentioned
- Error messages detected

---

## 13. Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Implement quick wins** (Section 12) - Low effort, immediate value
2. **Create saved replies** for maintainer consistency

### Short-term (2-4 Weeks)

1. **Build Phase 1 MVP** - Information request bot
2. **Test on 10-20 issues** before enabling broadly
3. **Gather maintainer feedback**

### Medium-term (1-2 Months)

1. **Implement Phase 2** - Solution suggester
2. **Build documentation index** for matching
3. **Measure success metrics**

### Long-term (If Validated)

1. **Phases 3-4** - Duplicate detection and enhancement context
2. **Consider RAG upgrade** if accuracy needs improvement
3. **Document as reusable pattern** for other projects
