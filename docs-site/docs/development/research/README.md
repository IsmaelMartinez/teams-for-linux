## Purpose

These documents capture:

- **Strategic insights** that inform development decisions
- **Comprehensive analysis** that might not fit in traditional documentation
- **Research findings** that provide objective evaluation of project components
- **Context and rationale** for major feature decisions
- **Investigation results** for proposed features and technologies

## Target Audience

These research documents are intended for:

- **Project maintainers** making strategic decisions
- **Contributors** understanding the broader context of features
- **Future developers** needing historical context
- **Documentation** of the decision-making process for major features

## Maintenance Guidelines

Research documents should be:

- **Updated** when significant changes affect the analysis
- **Referenced** in PRDs and major feature discussions
- **Used to inform** future project direction decisions
- **Preserved** as historical context even when superseded

:::note Documentation Lifecycle
While technical documentation should be kept current, research documents serve as historical records and may represent analysis from specific points in time.

## Contributing Research

When adding new research documents:

1. **Follow naming convention**: Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
2. **Include context**: Date, scope, and purpose of analysis
3. **Link related documents**: Cross-reference relevant files
4. **Update this index**: Add entries for new research documents
5. **Provide actionable outcomes**: Include clear recommendations or decisions

## Document Template

Research documents should include:

- **Status** - Current state (Research Complete, Ongoing, Superseded)
- **Date** - When the research was conducted
- **Summary** - Executive summary of findings
- **Analysis** - Detailed investigation and findings
- **Decision/Recommendation** - Clear outcome or next steps
- **References** - External sources and related documentation
