# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant technical decisions made in the Teams for Linux project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help:

- **Document the "why"** behind technical choices
- **Preserve context** for future maintainers
- **Enable better decisions** by learning from past choices
- **Onboard contributors** faster by explaining rationale

## Creating New ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- Have significant architectural impact
- Affect multiple modules or systems
- Involve trade-offs between alternatives
- Need to be explained to future contributors
- Change existing patterns or conventions

### ADR Template

Use this template for new ADRs (save as `docs-site/docs/development/adr/00X-your-title.md`):

```markdown
---
id: 00X-your-title
---

# ADR 00X: [Title - Short Noun Phrase]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Implemented | Rejected | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Context

What is the issue we're trying to address? Include:
- Problem description
- Why this needs a decision now
- Technical background and constraints
- What we investigated or researched

## Decision

What did we decide to do? Be specific:
- Exact approach chosen
- Implementation strategy
- Key parameters or configurations

## Consequences

What are the impacts of this decision?

### Positive
- Benefits gained
- Problems solved
- Improvements delivered

### Negative
- Trade-offs accepted
- Limitations introduced
- Future constraints

### Neutral
- Implementation notes
- Maintenance considerations
- Migration requirements (if applicable)

## Alternatives Considered

What other options did we evaluate and why were they not chosen?

### Option 1: [Name]
- Description
- Pros
- Cons
- **Why rejected**: [Specific reason]

### Option 2: [Name]
- ...

## Related
- ADR-XXX: [Related decision]
- Issue #XXX
- PR #XXX
```

### ADR Naming Conventions

- **Number**: Sequential (001, 002, 003, ...)
- **Title**: Short, descriptive noun phrase
- **Filename**: `00X-lowercase-with-hyphens.md`

**Examples:**
- ✅ `001-desktopcapturer-source-id-format.md`
- ✅ `002-token-cache-secure-storage.md`
- ❌ `001-screen-sharing-bug-fix.md` (too vague)
- ❌ `001-ImplementDesktopCapturerFix.md` (wrong case)

### ADR Workflow

1. **Create draft ADR** with "Proposed" status
2. **Discuss with maintainers** (GitHub discussion or PR)
3. **Update status** to "Accepted" or "Rejected" based on outcome
4. **Implement** (if accepted)
5. **Update status** to "Implemented" when deployed
6. **Add to this index** in the appropriate topic category

## ADR Maintenance

### Updating Existing ADRs

- **Status changes**: Update when implementation completes or decision is superseded
- **Consequences**: Add learned lessons or unexpected outcomes after implementation
- **Version notes**: Add when decision affects specific releases

### Superseding ADRs

When replacing an old decision:
1. Create new ADR documenting the new approach
2. Update old ADR status to: `Superseded by ADR-XXX`
3. Link new ADR to old one in "Related" section
4. Explain in new ADR why the old approach was replaced

### Example Supersession

```markdown
## Status

~~Accepted~~ → Superseded by [ADR-008](008-new-approach.md)

**Note**: This approach was replaced in November 2025 due to [reason].
See ADR-008 for the current implementation.
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Good ADRs

✅ **Do:**
- Write for future readers who don't have your context
- Explain the "why" more than the "what"
- Document alternatives considered
- Include specific examples and code references
- Update ADR when you learn something new post-implementation

❌ **Don't:**
- Write implementation documentation (that belongs in module READMEs)
- Skip the consequences section
- Forget to add links to related issues/PRs
- Leave status outdated (update when implemented)

### ADR Size Guidelines

- **Minimum**: ~200 words (if shorter, might not need an ADR)
- **Typical**: 500-1000 words
- **Maximum**: No hard limit, but consider splitting if >2000 words

### Code References

When referencing code in ADRs:

```markdown
**Implementation**: `app/browser/tools/tokenCache.js`
**Configuration**: See `config.json` → `tokenRefreshInterval`
**IPC Channel**: `token-refresh:trigger`
```

## ADR Statistics

- **Total ADRs**: 15
- **Implemented**: 7
- **Accepted**: 3
- **Proposed**: 1
- **Rejected**: 4
- **Average length**: ~500 words
- **Topics covered**: 9 (Authentication, Screen Sharing, Documentation, Release Process, MQTT & Integration, Testing, UI Features, Distribution & Packaging, Security)

## Questions?

- **"Should I create an ADR for this?"** → If you're asking, probably yes. When in doubt, create one.
- **"Where do implementation details go?"** → Module READMEs. ADRs explain "why", READMEs explain "how".
- **"Can I update an old ADR?"** → Yes! Add consequences learned or update status. Don't rewrite history, but do add learnings.
- **"What if my decision was wrong?"** → Document it! Create a new ADR explaining why you're changing course. This is valuable learning.
