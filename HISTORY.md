# History

This project originated as a fork of
[JamieMagee teams-for-linux](https://github.com/JamieMagee/teams-for-linux)
repository, which itself was forked from
[Ivelkov teams-for-linux](https://github.com/ivelkov/teams-for-linux).

Jamie expressed interest in refactoring the project to use TypeScript and
supporting it long-term. However, he eventually archived his fork. I attempted
to contact Ivelkov for several months without receiving a response. As a result,
I decided to refork the project and fix various issues. Over time, the list of
fixes and added features has grown considerably, addressing many bugs and
expanding functionality.

To unlock additional GitHub functionalities, we eventually unforked the project
[#87](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/87).

Initially, the plan was to let the project die once Microsoft implemented a
native Linux client, as suggested on the
[Microsoft Suggestions Forum](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/16911565-linux-client).
Microsoft did release an official Linux client in early 2020.

However, by the
[end of 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1791839/where-is-teams-for-linux),
Microsoft stopped its support for that client, forcing users to switch to the
[Progressive Web App (PWA) version](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamsblog/microsoft-teams-progressive-web-app-now-available-on-linux/3669846).

Support for this project continues because many users still prefer this
open-source alternative. Their contributions — whether through issues, ideas, or
pull requests — are a vital part of this growing community.

Today, the project is stable and will continue to evolve as long as there is
community interest. Non-stable versions are released as pre-releases. We
appreciate any contributions that help keep this project thriving.
