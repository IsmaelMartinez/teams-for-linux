# History

This branch was a child fork of [JamieMagee teams-for-linux](https://github.com/JamieMagee/teams-for-linux) repo, that was itself a fork of [Ivelkov teams-for-linux](https://github.com/ivelkov/teams-for-linux).

Jamie did express his desire to refactor this project in Typescript and to support it, but he has archive the project and I suspect that means he doesn't have the time to support it.

I have tried to contact Ivelkov for a few months but haven't receive any answers.

For that reason, decided to refork it and fix a few things that where not working. The list has grown since then to support many features and to fix most of the bugs.

To be able to use a few github functionalities, it was decided to unfork the project [#87](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/87).

The original idea was to let the project die when Microsoft implemented a desktop client for Linux, as requested on the [Microsoft Suggestions Forum](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/16911565-linux-client). Microsoft did released a Linux client on February 13, 2020 ([Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app#desktopAppDownloadregion), [Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/get-clients#linux)).

However, by the [end of 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1791839/where-is-teams-for-linux) Microsoft stopped its support. 

The support for this project didn't stop as some users still preferred this open source version. Their contributions keep this project alive, and are the main part this community still growing. 

Currently, the project is in a stable condition, and should continue as long as the community needs it. Non stable versions are released as pre-release. We do appreciate any contributions, from issue, ideas to PRs, and anything in between. Those contributions are what keeps this project alive.
