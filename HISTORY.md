# History

This branch was a child fork of [JamieMagee teams-for-linux](https://github.com/JamieMagee/teams-for-linux) repo, that was itself a fork of [Ivelkov teams-for-linux](https://github.com/ivelkov/teams-for-linux).

Jamie did express his desire to refactor this project in Typescript and to support it, but he has archive the project and I suspect that means he doesn't have the time to support it.

I have tried to contact Ivelkov for a few months but haven't receive any answers.

For that reason, decided to refork it and fix a few things that where not working. The list has grown since then to support many features and to fix most of the bugs.

To be able to use a few github functionalities, it was decided to unfork the project [#87](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/87).

The original idea was to let the project die when Microsoft implemented a desktop client for Linux, as requested on the [Microsoft Suggestions Forum](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/16911565-linux-client). Microsoft did released a Linux client on early 2020.

However, by the [end of 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1791839/where-is-teams-for-linux) Microsoft stopped its support, urging users to use the [PWA version](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamsblog/microsoft-teams-progressive-web-app-now-available-on-linux/3669846).

Support for this project continues as some users still prefer this open-source version. Their contributions keep the project alive and are a significant part of this growing community.

Currently, the project is stable and will continue as long as the community needs it. Non-stable versions are released as pre-releases. We appreciate any contributions, whether they are issues, ideas, PRs, or anything in between. These contributions are what keep this project thriving.
